 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
    As Clement Jermy was beginning his stint as the second generation Jermy at Marlingford in the 1590s, so his cousin <font color="blue"><b>Thomas Jermy</font></b>, third son of his father’s brother Robert, was apparently becoming established as the first generation at distant Saxlingham, near the north Norfolk coast. (See pedigree for the Later Jermys of Norfolk (1) and that for the Marlingford branch above).  This seems to have been on an estate that Thomas had purchased (or was purchased for him by his father?) - since he is described as an Esq of that place (at least by Blomefield), formerly owned by the Heydons and by Sir Henry Sydney.  However, in 1592, he is shown as acquiring another, smaller north Norfolk Manor - at Saxthorpe (also formerly the Heydons) - but as Thomas Jermy, Gent.  Or, did he acquire these properties through marriage?  He doesn’t appear to have thrived there, nor had more than one or two sons (if that) to carry it on.  Equally, his elder brother John, the Diocesan Counsellor, may have acquired it from Thomas ca 1615-20, say, or even have owned it from the start.  As explained , there is some confusion as to just who did reside there in the early 1600s.  Intriguingly, the name <font color="blue"><b>Edmond Jermy</font></b>, occurs again here (seemingly) - born about 1605 and, with a wife Anne, had yet another Edmond - in 1638 - as well as of two daughters.  But we note that the name Edmond ‘Jermy’ also occurs in the more southerly Saxlingham <i>Nethergate</i> area (as ex-Jermyn) and the assumed northern family of Jermys of Saxlingham by Holt (near Bayfield where they were certainly later settled) may yet turn out to be in error.  Any later parish registrations that might clarify the matter could be lacking due to the Civil war.  Further evidence, which should exist, is clearly needed here.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
    Two incumbents were presented to Saxlingham by Holt church in 1620 and 1625 - by John Jermy of Gunton - and another in 1636 by his son Francis Jermy of Gunton.  Oddly, however, the living at Bayfield itself (where there was no viable church) was presented in 1636 by Sir William Yelverton.  Sometimes the ‘advowson’ is retained when a Manor is sold.  However, I have details of a property transaction which shows Robert Jermy in 1636 as still being ‘of Edgefield, Esq’ - land which certainly went many years later to the widow of Robert’s great grandson John Jermy.  [It may be pertinent that the Manor of ‘Glandford Cum Bayfield’ appears to have been sold by Sir William Yelverton on 2 Oct 1638 to Francis <i>and</i> Robert Jermy; this may well represent Bayfield itself and explain our uncertainty as to which brother owned it originally; it was apparently owned jointly by them both.] The Marie Jermy who married John Allen at Saxlingham may have been of this Saxlingham Jermy family - or, she may have been of the later Bayfield line, who sometimes used this church. The possible Saxlingham origin of the <font color="blue"><b>Rev Thomas Jermy</font></b>  (later Rector of Buxton, Norfolk) of this same period is also uncertain.  We will see later that a possible nephew of this Saxlingham family - the Rev Anthony Jermy of the Gunton family - also married in Saxlingham - as his wife and her first husband (who would know the Jermys) resided there previously.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Finally, as also noted in the Marlingford section, we see that another Edmond Jermy (born ca 1670?) and wife Ann (who may have married in Bixley in the 1690s) had three daughters baptised at Brumstead (just north of Ingham and, like Saxlingham, near the north coast of Norfolk, but a bit further east) - around 1700. This man appears to be the Edmund Jermy, later a Maltster of Ingham, who is shown as such I believe in a Poll Book for 1734 (although this is sometimes shown (?wrongly) as <i>Edward</i> Jermy, I believe) and left a Will proved 8 Oct 1737 in which he mentions sons <i>Clement</i>, Thomas and Matthew Jermy (likely born ca 1706-14).  To whom was this Edmond born?  Possibly to the Edmond born at Saxlingham in 1638?  Or, possibly more likely, to the Clement of the Marlingford family - born ca 1640?  The Marlingford origin seems the more likely since the discovery of the Edmond Jermy born to a Clement and Ann Jermy in nearby Hethersett (next to Bawburgh) in 1668. The remainder of this account of this isolated cluster of Jermys on the north-east coast of Norfolk has therefore now been transferrd to the Marlingford section until shown otherwise.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We may consider next the earlier aspects of the senior branch of the Norfolk Jermys who resided at Gunton, also in the north of the county, for about a century - from just before the civil war.<p>
