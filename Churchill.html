<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:7.1pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   When re-visiting
a local National Trust property near York recently  (Beningborough Hall), my wife and I decided to
take a look at the Hall itself this time  rather than just the Walled Garden,  with its interesting collection of Old Fruit Trees. The previous owners (the Bourchier family)  hadn't lived  in this 3000 acre estate for  years - since it housed Air Force personnel
during World War II. Just off the impressive
entrance foyer, was a small room devoted to the sale of Used Books (with profits
to the Trust). It included a few more
serious or academic choices than typical of such shops and  I noticed a two Volume set on the '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Life of the Duke of Marlborough'</b>
written by his notable descendant Sir
Winston Churchill, in the early'30s. As
I knew little about the period of English history concerned, and it was rather
reasonable in price, I happily bought it. The following is my condensed account of a major part of that earlier
Churchill's life,   to which has been
added a deeper analysis of  his  family's genealogy, to augment that provided
in the book itself or, indeed,  as seems  available generally, usually with gross
errors.<o:p></o:p></span></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:1cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">            As with most biographies, the book begins (conveniently
for our interests)  with an account of
the  Churchills' then <u>recent history
and background</u>. Whilst I'd pursued the
genealogy of several families as a hobby some years ago, this was not my main motivation
in acquiring the present book. However, I
appreciated that it might provide interesting insight into some common characteristics
of  two  remarkable members of that one family, albeit living
250 years apart. I'd  read a book some years ago by our more
contemporary Churchill  in which  he  touched briefly on his family's origins,  namely, in the border area of Dorset and
Devon, in south west England. I'd gained
an impression of earlier solid Yeoman stock who had probably taken their
surname (or had been accorded such) by virtue of the family's much earlier
residence near some noteworthy Church, situated on a local hill   around  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1300</b>,
say, when most surnames were first  evolving.  From there, in any case, they had seemingly spread
and prospered  further afield   being so
identified henceforth.   Such an  origin would however  prove to be quite  mistaken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   Reading the present biography's Preface renewed
my awareness that Churchill's prose has been much praised, and appropriately
so.  In it, he essentially sets out the
main facts on which the glowing reputation of his illustrious Ducal ancestor, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill, </b> was based and on which the author's obvious worship
of him was understandably founded. There
had however been many earlier biographers of 'Marlborough' who, in Winston's view,
were clearly biased against him   for rather ambiguous reasons. As a result, it was taken by many that there
was an enormous miss-match between his successful deeds and career on the one
hand and the credit later accorded him by the British public at large, on the
other.  Later, others (of acknowledged
standing) had encouraged Churchill to 'set the record straight' and hence this
biography, entitled '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Marlborough - His
Life and Times</b>', was written, and later published by him, in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1933 </b>- essentially to realise this
purpose (and maybe give himself some breaks from building his famous serpentine
wall at Chartwell, around that same time   during  his so called 'wilderness years'   of the '30s).  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         The two 'Volumes' are more correctly
described as Books One and Two which contained , respectively, Volumes 1 and 2,
and Volumes 3 and 4, of the original
work.  Each of these 4 'original Volumes'
have their own sets of numbered Chapters 1 to 25+ !  It is certainly
thorough and covers essentially the century from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1650</b> to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1750</b> - that is,
from the Stuart through to the Georgian
era    of essentially English history.  The genealogical coverage of the Churchill
family, however, focuses more on the preceding Tudor period - of Henry VIII   and
his daughter and heir  Elizabeth I - that
is, mainly through the preceding <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500s.</b>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   While the bulk of these volumes provides
immense detail of the results of the author's extensive  archival research, the brief Preface is itself  of considerable value in that  much of that massive detail is summed up in more
general terms there, and more 'to the point'.  It is worth reproducing a little of this here (lightly
paraphrased) to provide a quick overview of what is later covered in such detail,
following our descriptions of the family's intriguing history and pedigree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:center"><b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><u><span style="font_size:12.0pt;

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">    Winston  thus begins by noting that  -..it is an interesting historical study to
examine the causes of the great disparity between the glory and importance of
John Churchill's deeds and the small regard for his memory later accorded him
by many of his countrymen.   He commanded the Armies of Europe against the
might of France (who had long been seeking European domination)  in 10 major campaigns, including 4 crucial
battles. He never fought a battle he did
not win, never besieged a fortress he did not take, never  rode off  a field of battle except as victor.  Until Napoleon a century later, no commander
wielded such wide-spread success and power across Europe. The union of nearly
20 previously confederated states centred on his person - when holding together the Grand Alliance against France    by both his military victories and  his later admired diplomacy.  In a virtual world war, involving the armies
and navies of all the civilised nations, he led them against the might of that
over-domineering France   for 25 years   and in so doing ultimately broke her -
irretrievably.-   I think this distils matters rather well
! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   This then was the British history I knew so
little about - essentially of the period  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1660</b>
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1730</b>.  Small wars were 'two a penny' then, as I
would soon discover.  It was all about
'reversing that prolonged domination in Europe of France', under Louis XIV (the 'Sun King')  by way of constantly shifting  alliances for and against him. And so, in a way, has it continued  to the present  day. Britain has recently voted (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">2016</b>)
to leave the E.U. but the new Prime Minister of France has just announced that
maybe they could adjust that  latter Union
to allow Britain to 're-join'. But, he wants also certain changes in Germany - whose economic power  and the value of the Euro, basically set by
them, seem to account for Grece, Italy, Spain
and Portugal all ;being seriously in debt, with high unemployment. And so it goes. Who should be dominant ? Whose standard of living should always be just
a bit better  than anyone else's ? The U.S.?  China,?  Europe ?  Germany ? France ? India ? Russia ?   Islam ?
    Who
basically should 'call the shots' 
especially their own ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  This
earlier period of concern had been described initially as that of 'the Franco-Dutch
war' or,  if a little later, of 'the wars
of William and Anne'   essentially between
France and everyone else.  Later, the War
of the Spanish Succession became embroiled in this same prolonged conflict. After considering the Churchill family
history and pedigree, we shall focus mainly of the earlier phases of John
Churchill's life and long military, and diplomatic, career, in dealing with
this on-going reality of his life. His
future roles in subsequent conflicts were well established by that stage (equally
successfully) and will be summed up here rather more briefly - culminating in
his victory  at Blenheim in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1704</b>. This saved Vienna and allowed the Grand Alliance to hold, after which
Louis's dominance faded inexorably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   Such wars and battles were not focused on mere
piecemeal gains in British territory or influence per se but rather as one part
of -<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">the larger struggle for a Protestant
Europe</b>-. Marlborough carried forward, said Churchill, all that was best of the
Protestant views of both Cromwell and the Dutchman William III  (despite the intervening monarchies of the pro-Catholic
brothers Charles II and James II in
England)   to establish the basis of our present constitution and democratic parliamentary
system - with  its<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"> established</i> Protestant churches  (of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, respectively). Ironically, religion is declining all over
Europe just now (except for their salaried hierarchies who still 'talk it up' with
a studied gravitas).  But, are there
still different cultural and religious views regarding 'democracy' and  'morality'   and who should ,really 'decide'
things   for the 'best' ? (A value
judgement if ever there was one.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Or,
as so succinctly  expressed in the
vernacular by Britain's  recent  Foreign Secretary   Boris Johnson (later PM) 
with respect to Britain leaving the European Union   -Its <u>not</u> about Immigration
or Jobs, its simply about '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Who calls the
shots' </b>- (as touched on above).  And
that is about national independence, sovereignty and democracy. Are grander
unions of neighbouring nations inevitable or only for temporary alliances in
times of  'extremis'? Who or what is 'right,' or 'best' ? 'good';  or 'bad' ? <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Who decides ?</b> It's not any of
our nations' 9 or 10 year old boys    still
being told to 'go outside and play';  it
is, rather, just <u>some</u> of those young lads (and now lasses)  - just a few years hence, when <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">one or two </i>of
them suddenly 'just know'   what's best
for the rest of us and wants to be 'the one who decides'.  Possibly it depends on how they've been 'conditioned'
during their youths.  Or, is it
testosterone ?  Or intelligence ? Or an urge to fulfil  one's assumed potential and 'destiny' ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Well, eventually,
someone has to decide, <u>and 'lead'</u>, presumably.  Societies that have not evolved such
leadership potential and choice methods are probably no longer here to tell a
different story.  But, is that by a
democratically elected 'cabinet', or by an unelected Commission (as in Europe)
- the Chosen ones  ?  Those potential leaders who seek eventually to
'take over' certainly rely very much on joining like-minded sub-groups and
circulating winningly within them - talking, persuading and 'taking the lead' -
but always with trusted companions; and
of course the backing and loyalty of a well-paid Army, Police force, and Political
party, certainly helps. And a
Church   with <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">its</i> leaders  ? Must
it always come down to --it's the economy, stupid-- ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">              Had the very determined plans of Louis XIV and
his senior Generals (some  of those once 9 year olds) proved triumphant
instead, the freedoms, religious and democratic, that we enjoy today would have
been warped and restricted even more, suggests Churchill. This would certainly have been the case had
either Napoleon or the Kaiser (or even Hitler) later fully dominated. One hadn't appreciated, previously, that just
as the German race, once consolidated, sought such domination in Europe   on
their two major occasions (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1914</b> and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1939),</b> so too had France    on their two comparable earlier occasions - in
the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1670-1710</b> period under Louis and,
from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1795-1815,</b> under Napoleon. Everyone, it seems, must have their turn -
essentially striving to dominate the then global economy and culture. With Spain, it was earlier and with Holland,
a little later. (There had in fact also been
two shorter 'Anglo-Dutch Wars' relevant to our story, prior to this present
focus.) And, we mustn't forget the
British Empire, with its early control of India and North America;  Japan  too,
and the USSR, have  now
had their  turns.  China next ? Russia ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:35.5pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">                     _ _ _ _ ___<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   Marlborough's amazing career began from a
surprisingly young age but he was consistently supported by the wisest counsels
in the land   who gradually recognised his multiple talents.  This support included the Monarchs and Dukes mentioned,
as well as such Ministers of state as Halifax, Shrewsbury, Russell, Cadogan and
Godolphin   who will be further identified below.  And yet, to quote the later Churchill (in
regard to his motivation in writing this biography) -fame shined unwillingly
upon this future statesman and warrior whose repeated exertions brought our
island and Europe safely through its perils   to produce its glorious results
for Christendom-. While Democracy vs
Dictatorship was certainly important, Religion too was much more relevant then than
I'd previously appreciated. It still is
- in places. Unlike the Cheetah, we, like
Lions and Baboons, are a social species -- although not <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">just </i>social, as some would prefer to believe; some freedom for the individual must still count. Surely, the <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">right</i>  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">balance</i>  should prevail,
according to current conditions and
needs of any given species, at given times.  We evolve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   While
the later analyses of John Churchill's  achievements weren't distorted directly by the
usual political suspects - ie the Whig vs Tory interpretations of history - as neither
party at that time had sought actively either  to defend or to  castigate him in the round.  A number of minor elements in his long career seem to have overly concerned
certain historians and writers who, for more vaguely political or professional reasons,
apparently sought to besmirch his name. This was done, said Churchill, by  -utilising every taunt, however bitter, every
tale, however petty, every charge, however shameful or not, arising from minor
incidents over a very long career.-  Maybe
it just 'sold copy' for certain
historians, and 'hacks' of the day. Like
most critics of talent in the Arts, Music, Sport, Literature and Architecture, say,
some Historians too take their assumed and self_selected roles and critical orientation
(typically without having created or accomplished anything too significant themselves)
 <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">very</i>
seriously. Gravitas abounds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">            Based
on such pretexts and on but one controversial incident (detailed later), a
succession of famous English writers had apparently sought to insult
Marlborough's  memory and reproach his
name. These included Swift, Pope, Thackeray and, especially, the historian Macaulay.
More modern writers, noted Churchill, had at least begun to reverse and correct
these distortions and prejudices of the previous 250 years.  He was now to be one of them. I hope to analyse the complex political and
cultural milieu in which John Churchill would make his mark, once into
adulthood, during this unstable and complicated period in pan-European history.
This is primarily to become more aware of and better understand it myself. You may or may not wish to join me.  There <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>is</u></i></b>
a lot of genealogy, ultimately - but it may be skipped !                     <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   Thus,
as mentioned, I would firstly address the matter of the Churchill family's
origins. This comes out in Churchill's
first Chapter, if only gradually and intermittently, inter-twined as it is with
necessary descriptions of the early years in the disrupted background of John
Churchill's parents, and grandparents, as well as of John himself. The times (essentially
of the English Civil War and the ensuing Commonwealth period, dominated by
Cromwell's Puritans) were very stressful and uncertain for the land-owning
gentry. The Churchill family background by this stage was certainly much above
that of the Yeoman level suggested earlier (with an interesting exception) but,
because of those times, certain false moves could well reverse any social or
economic gains in a trice. The future was
most uncertain for many. That old  adage
of the gentry and aristocracy   'what we have, we hold'    was no longer as certain and achievable as had
long been the case. But, it was often
accompanied by the injunction of the same class:  'Never complain, never explain'; just get on with it.  Many did.  Quality will out (eventually), it seems, as I
hope we shall see. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that forename   reflecting the mauden name
of his mother, Elizabeth <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Winstone</i>) and to his wife   Elizabeth (nee Drake). The year <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1650</b>
is almost prophetic   falling as it did exactly mid-way between the end of the confused
Civil War decade, of the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1640</b>s, when
Charles I was eventually overthrown and executed (having rigidly insisted that,
as King, his views on religion, and his
role in it, should prevail), and the end of the following decade  - being the Commonwealth period under Cromwell,
when the religious Puritans (Roundheads or Parliamentarians) were in the ascendancy    until <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1660</b>.
  John would thus grow up - to the age of 10 at
least   knowing only that latter, anti-Royalist, 'anti-establishment culture'
with its fundamentalist Christianity (Puritanism) that increasingly dominated
then.  Many felt that both Anglicanism
and Catholicism had become too hierarchical and authoritarian, in that sphere
of control.  But, it was essentially -we know best-
wherever one looked.  No one knew then of course, including young
John Churchill, that this new Puritan religious and cultural milieu 'wasn't necessarily
going to last forever'.  Many Puritans,
leaving for America a few years earlier, weren't  too sure either. When looking back on History, it seems very
difficult to ignore what we know today (and 'they'<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

estate in south-west Dorset that would prove to be the seat of one branch of an
ancient west-country family - <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">the Drakes</b>
situated just inland from the small port town of Lyme Regis.   Earlier
relatives named Ashe had resided there previously and hence the estate's name. And
the Drakes also held sway nearby - at Colyton in Devon. The  location and relevance of Ashe House in our
story becomes clear only gradually in the author's otherwise excellent prose. However, we can cut to the chase to some
extent by introducing and identifying the principal players and their roles rather
quicker  than  Sir Winston felt necessary.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">    We note firstly that Ashe House was situated
in that Dorset-Devon border area where Churchill had roughly placed the source
of his ancestors, as mentioned above. But this proved to be a slightly false lead.  In fact, they seemed, initially at least, to have
been established rather earlier  further
into the heart of Dorset itself, nearer the northern  parishes of Minterne Magna and Wooton
Glanville, some miles north-east. But,  even earlier, they appear to have  settled slightly north of that in turn   in the
county of Somerset rather, and before that even   in Devonshire.   Thus, Ashe House (located just into south-west
Dorset) was in fact but a temporary abode for the Churchills latterly - for about
a dozen years at most.  Their Somerset
and/or Devon origins are much earlier and more complex. And before that ? We shall certainly see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;text_indent:35.5pt;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt 460.7pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> While John Churchill and his siblings would thus
be born and grow up under wartime conditions at Ashe House near the Dorset-Devon
border, this was due entirely to the temporary circumstances of their father
Winston Churchill during the Civil War. He was a Royalist Officer in the King's Army; that is, a Cavalier, supporting
the King, and hence often 'on the run' from capture by the increasingly ascendant
Roundheads - as they progressed successfully to their eventual victory. Fortunately, in a way, Winston, essentially then
of Wooton Glanville, Dorset, as was his father <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">John Churchill Snr</b>, a local lawyer, would marry the daughter of one 'Lady Eleanor Drake', who did reside at
Ashe House. 'Fortunately', as she (and her then deceased husband) were,
paradoxically, Puritan supporters of Cromwell's
Roundheads - ie on the Parliamentary side !   This
contrasted with most of the country </span><span style="font_size:13.0pt;

in</span><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">
that national conflict   where the west-country's
 rural under-classes and a few only of
its  property-owning gentry - as the
Drakes   were such supporters.  In
today's terms, the latter would be left-of-centre Socialists and Liberals (and often
Non-conformist (Methodist) in religion), while the Royalists would typically be
the land-owning Conservatives and successful Merchants - generally of an Anglican  persuasion    as members of  the established state 'Church of England' -
with its remarkable propensity to adapt, tolerate and survive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt 460.7pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Lady Drake was the widow of Sir John Drake
 and being now on her own, was concerned
about a rather fervent Royalist neighbour (Lord John Poulett). So, in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1644</b>,
she requested that a guard of Roundheads be placed at her disposal   to protect
her and her 3 daughters. But, before
they could be fully deployed, that neighbour did indeed attack her estate and
partially burn down her large manor house. Lady Drake and family then took refuge in the nearby port town of Lyme
Regis for a time (already in Roundhead
hands), before moving on to London for temporary accommodation, again provided
by the latter powers who then held the capitol and also dominated there.  As in the American civil war of 200 years
later, many families and regions were split right down the middle - on either
religious or economic/political/racial lines (or both).   One is
reminded of the Brexit controversy today.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt 460.7pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">           Oddly, in the middle of this national
conflict, it had been arranged (probably by Winston's father John Churchill Snr)
that his son, a Royalist as himself, should marry this daughter of a noted and
landed <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Cromwellian</i> supporter. [It was later discovered that the Drake
family had previously held the Manor and
Castle of neighbouring Colyton in Devon,
only 5 miles away, with which an earlier Churchill also had connections and the
two families may well have known each other, at least from then - partially explaining this marriage choice,]         They had  married the same year as that arson incident
at Ashe House - in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1644</b>. But the young Churchill couple lived mostly
apart from each other in those early years of their marriage - with Elizabeth remaining
with her widowed Drake mother, and her sisters for the next 4 years   in that
London accommodation provided for them.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt 460.7pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Proceedings were soon commenced
against Lord Poulett that eventually gained her only &pound;1500 (of the estimated &pound;5000
damages (worth 70 or 80 times or more in today's currency). During this time, young Winston would have
been stationed with his regiment in continually changing venues - that is, over
the period <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1645-47</b>   as the conflict
still raged throughout the country in much confusion.   But, by
late <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1647</b>, he and his wife were apparently
able finally to live together, but still with her mother Lady Drake - when  the young family  all returned to a still damaged Ashe House in south-west
Dorset. This at least afforded them some
Roundhead security, if under rather Spartan conditions for landed gentry - in
their burnt-out shell of a home. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt 460.7pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">             While
Winston was able to avoid arrest and fines by the Roundheads  there (it being assumed to be a non-Royalist,
non-threatening household) for the next 2 or 3 years, he was eventually brought
to justice   as the Roundheads saw it - for having been an active 'Captain in
the King's army'. His fine, still
addressed to 'Winston Churchill of Wooton Glanville, Dorset, <u>Gent</u>' amounted
to about &pound;450   which was considerable for a man whose estate (a part only of
that of his lawyer father  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill, <u>Esq</u></b>   also of
Wooton)   was worth but &pound;160 per annum (as received from its rents and
profits). This left him too little to
maintain his own  marital home <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">there</i> and, in any case, his widowed father had recently re-married and, as Winston
 didn't get on with  his new step-mother, they soon moved back into
Ashe House with his mother-in-law and family, at least initially, for the protection
that her status could still provide. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">           [We may note here that one's social status in
those times (and for centuries before) was described, in ascending order, as 'Labourer,
Husbandman, Groom, Yeoman, Gentleman (Gent) and Esquire (Esq)'; above this  were the Knights ('Sirs') and the Nobility ('Lords') and
finally,  Royalty. While both Winston and his father lived at
their small estate in Wooton Glanville, the father, John, still its sole owner,
was thus an Esq, while his adult son would remain a Gent, until and if inheriting
the estate himself.  At all levels, there
were continual attempts to make out and aspire to be seen as being of the
station above that which the facts (if known) would typically warrant.  If, at marriage, one falsified one's current social
status, a fine could be levied.  Many men
working and living in the larger cities would often still be classed along
these same 'rural' lines   as a Groom or a Yeoman, say, even if no longer having
anything to do with  country estates or
farming per se(often on  rented land   as
a tenant or Yeoman/Copyholder  (when that
status was enrolled (Copied) into the manor's permanent estate record's on
vellum). The point was they had <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">to work</i> - with or without using their
hands; a proper Gentleman (and/or Esq)  on the other hand, didn't <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">have</i> to; he had other more
reliable  income sources.   It was
sometimes a fine distinction.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> An Esquire owned his own land (Freehold)
<u>and/or</u> received sufficient income
from it or from investments or a quality profession; a young Gentleman was
often in a more precarious position (reliant on others)   just below that level
but usually quite well educated. Prudent Yeomen with savings could lend money to imprudent Gents and Esqs
and eventually buy them out, and so ascend the social scale.  Marriages generally entailed property
agreements   with little or no cognizance taken with respect to any mutual love
or affection. And primogeniture assured that estates remained essentially
intact over the generations   by descending only down the eldest sons'
ownership; not split up endlessly
between siblings and cousins over successive generations , as in some  countries (eg  France). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

status   as semi-gentry. And some 'Freeholders' were actually only
Leaseholders if their  property was
originally held  'of the King (Crown)' or
'of some very early Norman Baron' (granted it by succeeding Kings ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1066-1400s</b>) and since forgotten, as families died out;
but actually still really 'owned' by distant others who had inherited such former
Crown estates for which albeit long Leases had  run out. Later Wills may leave property to
heirs that were originally in the form of 500-year  leases which, unrealised, had  long run out.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

!) would follow, but most did not survive.  Baptisms were registered at St Michael's,
Musbury, the nearest parish church (with some property there owned earlier by
the Drakes) - albeit located just inside Devonshire. The Vicar there (with
Puritan oversight?) would probably have provided some early education for the
boys at least   including John and his brothers George and  Charles, in the later <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1650s</b>. But it is more
probable, notes Churchill, that their father would take control of that
subsequently   as he was himself of an academic bent (having been to Oxford (ca
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1630</b>s) but with no large estate yet to
manage, or profession (beyond the Army) to pursue. Indeed, he had the time and interest to
investigate his own family's <u>uncertain genealogy and armorial status</u>,
being eventually motivated to do so because of its advantages in 'those times'
(described later).  They were finally
able to return to his own property in Wooton by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1660</b>, after Winston's father had died the year before (as, coincidently,
had Cromwell and his Commonwealth experiment). Both events would provide Winston Churchill and family with a more
secure, if modest, lifestyle, estate and future - as appeared initially to be
the case. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with the period of the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Restoration</b>  (of the Monarchy), when Chares II  returned from exile in France - if still under
the protection and  financial support of
Louis XIV (a fellow Catholic).  Such
events seemed to re-energise Winston Churchill.  He was soon elected as M.P for the important
Dorset port of Weymouth (previously held by members of the local Bond family (of
Steeple and Dorchester) where they seem to have played the Roundhead 'card').
And Winston also became virtually a founding member of the new Royal Society of
leading academics in London. Many
arrangements and compromises were forthcoming between the former opposing sides
- whether based on religious or political differences. Old scores were settled
and gradually parliamentary government <u>under a King</u>, generally with<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">his</b></i>

the Monarchy  - once more became one of
the realities of daily social and political life, and of economic influence,
advancement and control.  One progressed in
life as much by whom you knew in that vague institution (the royal 'Court'), as
by what you knew, although the latter apparently
did still count to a certin extent - and  rather more in England than it did in more
rigid France - with its comparable  royal
Court - until its comparable Revolution a century ot more later. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

advancement of himself and, increasingly, of his eldest son, John Churchill -
still only 12 to 14   as this new order evolved in the early <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1660s  </b>of the Restoration period.  Winston no doubt continued to oversee his
son's education locally, but would be on the lookout for a placement for him in
Royal or Court circles and/or into a good 'Public' school. His own background was in the Army (although
he had briefly attended University, and one of the  Inns of Court (where lawyers were trained)  and he likely still had contacts in those
spheres as well. Moreover, his steadfast support for the Royalist cause over
the difficult years of the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1640s</b> and
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">'50s</b> meant that the King's advisors
sought special consideration for him (and others like him) within the financial

account, our author Churchill remarks on the seeming special treatment his
earlier namesake received for his recognised merits and services for the King's
executed father Charles I, and now for his own role as an active M.P. in the
new royalist parliament under Charles II. For one thing, his Churchill family's Coat of Arms was to be 'augmented'
to a higher standing, something that he was known to be seeking after his own
recent investigations   of the family's long-uncertain<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

another, he obtained a position for his

point, we pause in our intended coverage of young John Churchill's subsequent military
and diplomatic career, and rise to fame, and return to consider further his
family's origins as ithey unfolded long before the Civil War.  In an examination of that earlier Coat of Arms, Winston found - likely with the
help of the long established College of Arms in London   that the
Churchill Arms appeared to be based on a
rather ancient one of  'Otho de Leon', who
was  described as the 'Castelan de
Gisorn' (seemingly in France), before <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1000</b>
AD.  Otho  was said to have had two sons - Richard (b. ca
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1020</b>) and Wandril (b. ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1025</b>) - the latter referred to as the 'Lord
of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Courcelle</b>' and --whose youngest
son (unnamed) came into England in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1066</b>
with William the Conqueror.- This line was then  roughly traced  over the next few generations (to, say, the
mid-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1100s</b>) when Winston noted a
certain  'John, Lord of Curricell' (or, 'as
in subsequent divers records' ''de Curechelle', 'later called<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">de</b>
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Churichille</b></i>', <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">in <u>Somersetshire</u>')</i>   whose son '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Sir Bartholomew de Churichelle'</b> was a
knight  of great note in the time of King
Stephen'   ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1140-50s</b>. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><u><o:p></o:p></u></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">    [We must note that this therefore <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">appears</i> to indicate that the original
source of the family and its name may well not derive <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">from</i> some 'church relevant hill' in southern England therefore
(whether Dorset, Somerset  or Devon), but
rather, ultimately,  from a manor or
district called something like 'Courcelle' in Normandy, or neighbouring Leon,  in France  ! The
early English manor (and later village) in Somerset had thus, seemingly, <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">acquired</i> its name - of  'Churchill'   <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

normal">and</i> a noteworthy hill nearby - or not ?  Seemingly not.  There would in fact be 5 or 6 other Manors and
villages in scattered locations across the country which all had this same
origin - post 1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">066</b>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         [We may note that, for a 'consideration',
the early College of Arms (or some in it) have been known to 'help' one establish an apparently valid pedigree. There appears to be sufficient
evidence in the Churchill case however not to have required that suspect assistance.
Moreover, another descendent whose early family settled in Oxfordshire (an Army
General) found the same pattern in his family's early names - having evolved gradually
 from such as Courichille, Cherichull,
etc.) And more recently, we have noted that the famous <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Great Doomsday Book</b> of 1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">086 </b>reveals that there were indeed about 4
other early Churchill Manors in other
west country counties whose names became established from similar  names of the sons, brothers and nephews of
that  same <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">one family </i>settled there that early. The villages concerned are mostly still there
today - now as 'Churchill' - all having evolved from such early forms of that Norman surname   as recorded in that famous Book of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1086</b> now held in the Public Record
Office (now  the National Archives)    in Kew. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Kidderminster, in Worcestershire, the Great Book lists (in folio 117r) a manor called then 'Cercehalle' (now
Churchill) with 40 inhabitants in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1086</b>
with names about 20% Norman French and 80% Anglo-Saxon); near Banbury in Oxfordshire was another
called 'Cerecelle' (now Churchill) where many of the  inhabitants (or property holders living
elsewhere) appeared to be high ranking, with titles and church positions. Another in Worcestershire was
called 'Circhehille'; and finally there
was one in Devonshire (folio 11r) called
'Cercelle' with 28 names with this same Anglo-saxon : Norman balance   one being 'William de Falaise' who was
likely the King himself who had various properties all over the country in his
own name, rather than held by 'the Crown'. This Devon Churchill was located about 10 miles north of Exeter and is

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  There doesn't appear to have been any attempt
to trace the spread of the earliest Churchills from their arrival in Sussex in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1066</b>     later
settling in such as the west country, or in any other general region.  All we can say is that they seem to have appeared
quite early in Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Worcestershire, Somerset and Devon   by
the late 11<sup>th</sup> and early 12<sup>th</sup> centuries. We shall however  describe another Norman family later (the
Bartelots; later Bartletts) who benefitted from their role in protecting one of
William's chief Barons and family (often Royal relatives) who had received
grants of property from the King in widely disbursed locations. (This to obviate cliques of close relatives
having  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">more cohesive power-bases</i> from which t to attempt rebellion) and as
a result the Bartelots were able themselves to settled nearby (through grants
of land from that chief Baron, in turn). These would be in locations verified
later by the frequent presence of their recent French surnames. Three or four
other families of similar origin, apparently inter-married, seemed to be
distributed likewise, if less widely or reliably, in these same areas,
especially <u>in the south and west of England.</u> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   One of
these families was indeed the Churchills - one son of whom (Bartholomew) had
also benefitted by his relationship with Ralph FitzRalph-(and marrying his
sister)  while  serving King Stephen in Somerset and Devon.  It is <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">this</i> branch of the family that we shall seek to trace out - from their
apparent beginnings in or before their association with Churchill, Somerset   without
knowing if any other branches (of 'de Courcelle')  had survived or prospered elsewhere. We shall
describe a situation later where the early Churchills appear to have spread
from Somerset south to Devon and <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">then <u>east</u></i>
to Dorset who could have linked up there,
around<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1450,</b>  with another branch which appears to have spread more directly from Sussex <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>west</u></i>  into Hamshire and Dorset  through the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">13</b> and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1400</b>s   unless their
presence there, (as near Corton, Dorset)  even preceded the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> There had in any case been little
time in that first post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1066 </b>century
to have resulted in more than 2 or 3 other early branches -
wherever. One family of 'Churchills' <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">seemed</i> to then continue residing in Somerset and/or north Devon
(see below) for several more generations   through the reigns of Henry 3<sup>rd</sup> (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1216-1272</b>) and the Barons'
Wars (against King John)after which, during the reign of Edward 1<sup>st</sup>
(<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1272-1306), </b> the Churchill manor in Somerset was apparently
seized by the Crown, with many others, (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1300</b>)
and given or sold to local favourites or some well-off local Yeoman. <u>During the<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

exact relationships and descents becomes, for a time,  more uncertain.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         That early Somerset manor (not
yet noted in the Doomsday Book) was, in
any case, later sold to a landed family named J<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">ennings</b>   who held it from about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1550</b> for a further century. During this extended period (200+ years), the Churchills would presumably
have had to survive locally, or elsewhere nearby, as best they could, depending
on what other resources, marriages, education or properties they may have managed
to arrange, hold or acquire - while ever seeking to maintain some social and
economic standing.  But, the detail of
the family's history over that  200 year period <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1350-1550</b>) appears to be  somewhat
 scant at this point. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">     As
a consequence, as pointed out by our more contemporary Winston, the family may
have become distributed into many levels of society in Oxford, Somerset, Worcestershire,
Devon and Dorset through the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">13th</b> to
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">15th </b>centuries, with some elements hopefully
still sufficiently educated and moneyed to resume their former position and
status   at the Gentleman and Esquire levels (that is, above that of Husbandman
or Yeoman), as conditions allowed.  Eventually,
after this period, the Jennings were forced to sell the Somerset estate    in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1652</b>
  to clear debts arising from the recent English Civil war - a common
problem among the gentry at the time (if one was on the wrong side).  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Who</i>
would then be able to buy it   in that later C<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

say (with some implied foreshadowing    clarified
below).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   This
brings us back to the time of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John
Churchill, Esq</b>, (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1630s-'50s</b>),
the Dorset lawyer of Wooton Glanville, and his son and grandson   <u>Winston</u> and <u>John Jnr</u> (of the Civil
War period <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

mainly of Henry 8<sup>th</sup> and his daughter Elizabeth 1st, there were still
some senior Churchills in that <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>general
west country</u></i><u> area</u>   connecting us back to the earlier Somerset family
and their  manor of Churchill (near
Bristol). This was many generations earlier of course - through the confusions
and troubles of the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1400s</b> (Wars of
the Roses) and into the ensuing, more stable, Tudor period of the 1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">500s</b>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  This assumption is assisted when we read
Winston's account (as conveyed by his later namesake) in regard to <u>the history
of the family's Arms and Manor(s</u>). For he points out that, confusingly, there was, after the Elizabethan
era, <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">another,</i> contemporary <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill</b>, also a noteworthy lawyer,
who achieved great distinction in both the  pre and post-Commonwealth  periods - but in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">London</b>  This was during the later stages of Charles  I's reign,  then through Cromwell's ascendancy  and into that of Charles II - post-1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">660</b>.  Where does this new John Churchill fit in, we
must ask - who appears to have been fully
 in neither political or religious camp  ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Indeed, he was (eventually) a knighted
'<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Sir</i>
John Churchill'</b>, who had risen to hold the significant legal posts of Attorney
General and latterly 'Master of the Rolls' by the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1670s</b> - advancing in stature from the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1640</b>s onwards   when he continued to thrive  and advance.  Such a sustained position would suggest he
wasn't necessarily of either a Roundhead or Royalist disposition, but someone
who kept his cards close to his chest.  Indeed,
he turned out to be a rather bright and influential character, if a bit of a
'chancer', who sometimes sailed rather close to the wind. Moreover, with his success, he'd acquired
sufficient wealth to retire    to the
west country himself   and purchase an estate there   namely, that at <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Churchill  </b>in north Somerset (!)<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

 (who, quite unexpectedly,  re-enter our story again in a totally different
context, and rather significantly, later). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">                     _ _ _ _ _ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

same one line of Churchills   one who also seems to have sought to re-establish
the family's  origins and bona fides
after the war - through the purchase of that earlier family Manor, one that we
would assume was relevant to their common descent.  He was  born around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1620, </b>oddly similar to that of our earlier Winston, and seeking much
the same thing.  Sir John Churchill was thus
younger than Winston's father, also a John Churchill (the <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">Dorset</i>  lawyer) - then
of Wooton Glanville, Esq)    who was  born near the end of the previous century - a
generation earlier.  Training in Law was
centred then at the Inns of Court in London and our older Dorset lawyer John, a
Cavalier and member of Middle Temple (one of 4 or 5 such 'Inns of Court'), would
surely have known this younger, and eventually more illustrious legal 'cousin'
 who was to become, and die as,   'Sir
John Churchill, Master of the Rolls'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm;tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Indeed, the younger man succeeded the older in
a position of Deputy Master of Chancery, even if they had trained at different Inns:   John of
Dorset  at Middle Temple (from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1614</b>) and <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">Sir</i> John of London (to be) at Lincoln's Inn   (from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1638, </b>somewhat later), both pre-Civil  war  days.
  For
that latter John, the times had apparently been quite good   in both Cromwell's
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1650</b>s, when that ancient Somerset estate
became conveniently available - <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>and</u></i>,
subsequently as noted,  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">after</i> the Restoration, post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1660. </b>He was thus a kind of 'Vicar of Bray' character.  His elder lawyer 'cousin', on the other hand,
back in Dorset, suffered somewhat for his continued adherence and loyalty to
the <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Royal cause </i>alone, as would his
son Winston Churchill in turn, now a contemporary of this knighted 'cousin'    the first Sir John Churchill.  But, ultimately, Winstin would match him -
becoming an MP, a founder of the Royal Society and father rof the Dulke of
Marlborough - to be given Blenheim Palace. Sir John had obut 3 daughters - who became an awkward expense to
marry off ! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">    A clue to the connection between these two
branches of the Churchill family (and to those who held the Churchill manor
earlier) is provided by a later comment made by said Winston  when he first refers to the forename of his own
grandfather - one <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">Jasper</i> Churchill</b> - that is, father of his  own father  John  Churchill,
Esq, the  Dorset lawyer (who was born, it
now appears, about  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

revealed father Jasper  was thus, in turn, likely born about<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1570 </b> in mid-Elizabethan  times. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>Moreover, Winston also usefully names  this Jasper's own father   as one  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Mathew</i> Churchil</b>l  (bn. ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b>),
near the end of Henry 8th's reign.  And Mathew  in turn, it seems, was the only a  son  of  one  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Roger</i>
Churchill </b> - likely born himself about
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1515 </b>or so, as estimated )   quite

suggested connection of these  differing Churchill
branches appears to arise from information on the paternal parentage of  Sir John Churchill, the successful London
lawyer, shown separately from our other sources. For Sir John's father is discovered   (confusingly)
to be <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">another</i> (but  younger<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">)

font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">    We note that the latter John
Churchill (the Dorset lawyer of Wooton Granville),  was described by our more contemporary (20<sup>th</sup>
century) Winston  as the one who most
improved the fortunes of<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">his  </b></i>branch
of the Churchill family at least - having, as mentioned,  become a Deputy Registrar in Chancery, as well
as being a member of Middle Temple in London himself.  He had  married quite well - into the aristocratic
Winstone family of Gloucestershire - and, as a Cavalier, did equally well for
his eldest son Winston in turn   in arranging <u>his</u> marriage    to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Drake, of
that important  west country family. The latter  was, albeit, of  a  more
liberal Parliamentary persuasion who, incidentally, had earlier produced Sir Francis
Drake, the Elizabethan explorer and that branch at Cloyton, Devon   near Ashe
House.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lawyer (bn  ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

himself up by his own bootstraps,  possibly
including arranging his own marriage with the daughter of a landed family, it
is equally likely that both he and his own father <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

earlier,  in  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1586</b>
 -  thus making three such John Churchill lawyers in
our story in a row - each seemingly of a different branch !  There was obviously talent in the family coupled
with  some education and increasing  financial security. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Winstone family (of distant Gloucester) - as through  a fellow law student in London of that family. We shall place his position in the family more
clearly below.  This John  may not have  practised as an active  lawyer however but would
likely put his legal training to good use (as many thus educated then did)  when inheriting and managing a family  estate with its often  litigious implications. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Granville (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1592</b>)  was able subsequently to purchase a little
more Dorset property   at Newton Momtecute (near Wooton) and at Minterne Magna (just
to  the south), in which the family
appears already to have had an interest   thus improving the overall value of
their otherwise modest mid-Dorset estate. All this would presumably be inherited by son Winston by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1660</b>, just after his father John died,
and the Monarchy had been restored - to Charles II. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

younger Sir John Churchill - the lawyer of London   also did well in this
regard   having married Susan Prideaux, daughter of Cromwell's Attorney General   Sir Edmund
Prideaux    of Devon, and later buying
that  former Churchill manor in
Somerset.  He had 4 daughters but no son. Marrying them off would however prove
quite an expense for him in his future retirement years. This type of problem had apparently happened quite often in earlier periods of the main Churchill
family descent as we shall see.  A
paucity of viable sons but several daughters would soon diminish the original Churchill
estates and their longer term
security. Oddly, the son of this John's younger
brother, Jasper, would later be in a position to help <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

somewhat  ambiguously, in his continuing <u>family

above mentioned Roger   of  equally early
birth (possibly being brothers or cousins, say)  when describing Roger's <u>wife</u> (the  mother of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Mathew</b>)
as -having been born a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Peverell</b>-    an ancient  landed  family  with earlier branches in several other
counties,   but now with few if any surviving or landed sons).  Early

 Jane thus appeared to have become  a widow (of Megges)    and so to then hold   <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">that</i> Somerset property in her own name -
as well as other <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Peverell</i> lands.  All this would be taking place (apparently) around

may help if any future  re-analysis seems
required (as in fact proved  to be the
case) to better account for that missing 125 years ! So, he continues: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and to (that John's  seeming brother) Roger Churchill, who, by the daughter (Jane) of Peverell,
relict of Nicholas Megges, had issue Mathew, the father of my grandfather
Jasper)-we enter a rather 'shady phase--(for)-  -Edward Harley (an earlier bibliophile) has rudely
asserted that our present John Churchill's great grandfather' (Jasper) was  (allegedly)  a Blacksmith (!)   who worked for  the
 Megges-. This, says Winston, was  --from a footnote, quoting an entry in a  'commonplace diary'  possessed by an  earlier  Duke of Portland and, certainly, as John's  gt-gt-gt grandfather  Roger had <u>apparently</u> married a <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">widowed</i> Mrs Meggs), this all seems

the future Duke (b <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1650</b>)     this indicates that after Roger Churchill allegedly married the widow Jane Megges (nee Peverell)   around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b>,
say    and soon had  by her a son Mathew Churchill (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1547</b>), who in turn had a son Jasper about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1570

 assume was  a landed
family whose son wouldn't normally have had to pursue such an occupation. But, if both Roger and Mathew died quite young (which sadly they both did),
Jasper would likely be in a rather vulnerable
position - more possibly  if his mother Jane had re-married yet again (by ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1575</b>, say) and young Jasper's welfare
was somehow then subordinated  to any later
issue Jane had by such a new  new husband
who, in those times, would assume full control of  her estate.  There was very little sentiment about then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 had to  pursue  this  surprising  role a little later.  But how would such employment be  described  as 'working <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

some mix up  in the facts <u>and dates </u>as
obtained (or recalled from his youth) by Winston - including the name and
possible location of  that rather later
Churchill manor - at  'Munston' or whatever. [See more later on relevant manors at '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Muston'</b>

font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  We thus  take particular note of the main  focus of  concern in analysing the family's
background when Winston  writes   --when we come to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John</b>,
ancestor of the present Churchills of Munston, and to Roger-etc - (as above), this ancestor, John Churchill, would apparently  be one living around early to mid-Tudor
times   <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1520 </b>to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1550</b>, say,  and so probably the  gt-gt-grandfather  of those Churchills  'presently' then resident there (at that later north Dorset manor)   a century or more later
ca  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1650-60s   </b>when Winston wrote those words.  Winston seemed  aware  of
there being such an earlier  branch of
the family - presently <u>then</u> still at such a place   but not very certain
 about  its name or location, nor exactly how that
earlier ancestor John Churchill may have been (or not) related  to Roger, nor when and where all this
happened. All rather vague and ambiguous.    <o:p></o:p></span></p>

tab_stops:411.1pt 418.2pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;
font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  One had assumed, after reading Winston's early
account,  that the sale of the Somerset manor  (to the Jennings) - possibly at a loss   was partly
resolved  by Roger  Churchill  conveniently  marrying this  now allegedly widowed heiress    Jane Megges (nee Peverell).   The new
family may then  have  re-settled (from the Somerset manor) to this other
and later family-owned manor   at 'Munston' (where that  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">earlier</i> John Churchill had seemingly<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"> already</i> been  settled a little <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">previously</i>
(beginning the shift from Somerset into (north) Dorset)   so further consolidating  a branch of the family already there   <u> ie  in
mid-north Dorset</u>, say, as seemingly described      with a parish of very similar name  coincidentally being quite close to Wooton
Glanville,  where Winston did grow up. Well, this was certainly the general impression
 received on first reading the earlier Winston's
 rather confused  account - with its suspicious, shady  and disquieting implications, as he himself
described them     of admitted uncertain validity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Glanville, seemingly  in mid-north Dorset
also , and to the later 're-ownership' of  the ancient 'Churchill' manor, in  Somerset,  all seemed
on the face of  it  <u>to be a  most reasonable  if  a little

since writing the foregoing, we have acquired further data on the family to
help fill in several gaps, inconsistencies and that suspected connection -
which now appears separately below (rather than seeking to merge or integrate  this new material into Winston's original but quite
uncertain conception, understanding  and structure).
 There may thus be some over-lap, repetition
and  necessary revision  in <u>our
new account</u>    now given below. Additionally, we shall have the important benefit
of an earlier  biography of 'John Churchill,
Duke of Marlborough', complied from many sources, including the archives at
Blenheim, written  in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1818,</b> by one <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William Coxe</b>.  This was originally intended to be written about
1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">750</b>  by one of two  respected historians of the day   suggested to
Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough in her widowhood   with a grant of &pound;1000. Desired
by her,  but, for whatever reason, this had
apparently never materialised.*  With the support of a later Duke of
Marlborough however (an inheritable title), Coxe ultimately took on this long
neglected project himself.  His effort  included a limited section on the family's
origins which we now incorporate into  our present re-analysis and understanding    gained from many  other sources.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sir Winston Churchill described  how his
namesake ancestor, the first Winston Churchill (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1620-1688</b>), sought to promote his family's interests after the
Civil War with the returning monarch
Charles II    by better establishing his own family's Pedigree
and Coat of Arms.  This would no doubt entail
assistance by the College of Arms in London, as well as examination of many old
documents held in national and local archives. A family's possession and right to such Arms was very important for
their security and advancement at the time.  The Monarch needed <u>trusted</u> families around him - where that trust had built up   over many
generations - reflected in their Coats of Arms and indicating  those who were well
established, reliable,  trustworthy, and
loyal - and be so    <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  It was thus concluded, as touched on above,
that the Churchill Arms implied descent from an ancient  family of one 'Otho de Leon' - which Leon was
a semi-independent region immediately to the south-west of Normandy, in France.
(They may have derived even earlier from the  Poitou  region
further south (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Cx</b>). [Also noted in Ld] Both Leon and Normandy were known to assist
each other in difficult times, before and after the year <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

England in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1066</b> - no doubt with promises of  land and property  if successful.  William's army thus consisted of about 20 or
so Chief Barons, each of whom would expect to gain and hold (under William and
'the Crown'), a major Barony or Honour of territory   each containing about 30  or  more often (purposely) widely-scattered Manors
(such as the Peverells).  Some of these could then be granted in turn by
the Barons to their respective senior  Knights
 and 'Companions' who fought with  them - so divided up that each received ('to
hold' of their Baron)  one or more 'knight's
fees' of land  -  each containing one or more Manors of, say,
500+ acres, and a good house.  In time, these would often be inherited or
effectively 'sold'   in - or - 'fee'

that first 'Churchill' was said to have received initial grants or rights (typically
under a more powerful Norman Baron, or his immediate 'Companion) to many smaller
Manor Lordships   in Somerset, Devon, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxford , and even (more
northerly) Shropshire (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Cx</b>).  [I have also noted one reference only of an
early Churchill manor in Hampshire.]         Amongst
these, Coxe singles out  (for whatever
reason, but see later)  a very small manor
called Corton in the parish of Portisham, near the south coast  -  just below
Dorchester, Dorset.  [Ld describes this as 'Corston', I
believe.) Various sales, tradings and transfers
of such properties then transpired between such 'landed'  families in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>period<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">
1100-1400+. </b>However, the overall if
disbursed Churchill estate in these various counties then became <u>gradually

of whom could rely on male primogeniture in inherit <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

 and the  resultant continuous sub-dividing of their remaining manors in order  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">to

their more significant properties thus
became increasingly tenuous as a means
of providing future financial security and status for later eldest Churchill
sons - ie by the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b>s. The same applied to the Peverells and to the
family called 'de Brionne' (later Brian). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Winston's and/or Coxe's findings  suggested
that Otho  (possibly appearing also as
'Gitto or 'Guido' (or vice versa)  through  uncertain  transcribing) [as by Ld]  had two sons - <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

to England with the Conqueror in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1066.-</b>   While Winston doesn't name this key first ancestor
of his own English line - ie 'Someone' de Courcelle', say,  one finds him named elsewhere [Ld] as a  '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><u>Roger</u>
de Courcelle'</b> (b ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1045</b>), the
son of  Wandril  de Courcelle  and wife  Isaabelle de Toya'   who likely married about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1040,</b> we estimate.  This Roger would still be be aged about 40 only at the time of the
Doomsday survey and thus identifiable as 'Roger' as an inhabitant or property
holder in any entry in same; one had no surname other than such as 'de Courcelle', say,  in
his case,  as the recent 'acquirer' of such
a manor (if later called 'de Churchill').  [ 'de Brionne' became 'de  Brian/Bryan' and 'Bartelot' became 'Bartlett', etc.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

port on the Normandy coast conveniently called 'Couricellum', allegedly founded
 in the late <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

as Brixham, in Devon, or Weymouth, in Dorset, for example) and that Wandril
likely already had some 'small fiefdoms' near there, as a consequence.  One does wonder if Corton in Portisham, Dorset - very near the south
coast (just below Dorchester)  - may have
been one such; Corfe Castle was nearby
and I've seen other Manors elsewhere spelt
as 'Cortune' sometimes transcribed as such as 'Corfeton' or 'Corseton' - possibly with the letters   't',  's'  and 'f'
 being confused in transcription).  Many Manor  names  often  evolved
by virtue of uncertain spellings over the centuries, in any case. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have no surname that early. 'Roger' was
a Norman name (not Anglo-saxon - as Alfric

of Ralph FitzRalph,  a Lord of Tiverton (later the home of the
Courtenays, Earls of Devon) - which is
about 14 miles north of Exeter (and significantly quite near Broadclyst   about mid-way between Exeter and  the apparently later manor of 'Churchill'  in north Somerset). We estimate that Bartholomew was born about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1110</b> and married Agnes ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1135. </b>He appears to have been knighted by Stephen around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1150</b>   for his bravery in protecting him from the forces of his cousin the
Empress Maude (Matilda) who was claiming the throne for some years  ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1140's-50's</b>. Bartholomew died in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

the FitzRalphs, possibly a brother-in-law - where both may have resided for a
time with their families. Significantly,
Bristol was not far from the  manor
of Churchill just along the north coast
and from where Bartholomew was latterly
said to 'be of'.  Its name would have
been established only after Bartholomew settled there - probably around the<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1140s </b>- and hence why it was not

time   in more southerly Broadclyst (where Bartholomew's mother Joan de Kilrington had apparently lived). Indeed, she and her husband John  de Courichelle
(and/or any other of their
children) may still have lived
there. And the Tiverton-based chief Overlord
 of the  area - Baron FitzRalph,  is said to have controlled over 30 manors thereabouts
quite possibly therefore including some in nearby  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Broadclyst

Devon (all  becoming Churchill in time). As noted, there was no reference yet to the

occurs as an inhabitant and/or property holder in  both the Devon and the
Worcester manors of that name (Curcelle or similar) ) . Most of the inhabitants at that time were
native Anglo-saxons with names that were often qualified by their  occupation. Where a forename occurs on its own, however, and is clearly of Norman
French  extraction, it generally implies
they would be of that manor's principal family (not their feudal 'staff') and known beyond the Manor  (and
its localised Doomsday context) by their
fuller name - as 'Roger de Curcelle' or,
possibly his brothers, 'Robert de
Curcelle', 'John de Curcelle', or
whatever.  Such titles (or full names) would be
unnecessary or  redundant for the Doomsday survey itself. And while everyone living there would also
be 'of there',  they would not normally be accorded that fuller name   that early and
local. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1080</b>, say, albeit residing mainly in just one of them.  It
would appear that the manor of Churchill in Somerset came into the family
(possibly as a gift to Bartholomew by the Fitz Ralphs) only later   by about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

been noted for it in the Archive records, but none before the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1200</b>s.  One is increasingly inclined to believe that

and the subsequent reign of Edward I (ie
ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1265-1300s</b>) by which time  the Lordship of the Somerset manor of
Churchill had apparently been seized by the Crown (during some conflict) and likely given or
sold to a local favourite,  or well-off  Yeoman. That latter family may then have  held

continue searching out the pedigree from the period after Sir Barthalomew de
Churchille  (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Coxe, the Churchills are, fittingly,  next located and established   in Devonshire   inter-marrying there with families of
distinction and property in the 13<sup>th</sup>   14<sup>th</sup> century (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1300</b>s).  However, no supporting names,
places or dates are given.  Rather, he
jumps  next to the reign of Henry VI (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1421-1470</b>).
during the War of the Roses, when he finds a -<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

descendent of Bartholomew', now seated, fittingly,  at <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Rockbeare,
</b>in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> Devon</b>-. [We may note that the uncommon term 'lineal' is also used in

-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Charles Churchill</b>, grandson of said
William, was  a distinguished warrior
during the troubled reign of Edward IV  (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1471-1483</b>) when he fought for that

name the intervening Churchill, son of this William and father of Charles,  but continues by describing subsequent members of this family, to which
we shall shortly return - after  first addressing
 those missing two centuries  in his account; that is, to consider the
period from Bartholomew to the above William Churchill -   from
before ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1200</b> to after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1400</b> !  Thus, from other sources (as Ld) we find that   Bartholomew's  eldest surviving son was the oddly named 'Pagan de Churchill' 
born about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1150</b>  (as estimated) to Bartholomew and  wife Agnes (FitzRalph).
 We know nothing for certain about where
he and any siblings were born or resided
however;   but mid-  to north-Devon would seem probable. (Note   I have come across sons of
other landed families with the unlikely first (given) name of 'Pagan' in this period.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Master of  Stephen's Castle  in Bristol (possibly in conjunction with  Ralph FizRalph)   where they likely both died defending
it. Were his family already residing
with him <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">there</i>, or were they with
Agnes' parents   the FitzRalphs    elsewhere
(as in or near <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Tiverton, </b>Devon<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b> a lttle further south (associated with the

FitzRalph and the de Brus surnames suggest a certain Norman or propertied status
 in  this early post-Conquest society. Some residential property consistent with
that must have been extant for the next
generation or so, but we have no direct clues as yet where this may have been;
was it near the manor of  Churchill,  at Broadclyst in south Devon ? The latter is beginning to look increasingly  promising and relevant. We  leave
this for now. Early property documents or Wills  at the PRO at Kew might one day prove more
informative. [Sdly, they didn't on a

of their Churchill  manors in Devon by
then.  [Yes - now confirmed via that
Doomsday entry!]  The older son of Pagan   Roger    is then shown as having a son <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Elias Churchill</b> (by unknown wife) in
about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1235-40 </b> - who in turn  married one Dorothy Columbieres   around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1275</b>.  That surname may again suggest someone of
French (or Norman) descent, and possibly 'landed' therefore;  <u>but</u>, one did note a local landowner in
 Broadclyst   a John Columbe  who seems to have had an important  property named Columbjohn (later incorporated
into the vast estates of Henry Courteney, 1<sup>st</sup> Earl of Devonshire).         Could Dorothy's surname have started out similarly
as -Columbeare', say    the suffix 'beare' being quite common and  meaning 'the woods'  in Devon and in the west generally ?  In neighbouring Rockbeare;  that  local manor was also known later  as 'Rock Wood'. It  was
 said to be given by the Bishop of Bath and Wells  to Matilda, then Countess of Gloucester,(ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1220s</b>)  mother of Henry II  and thence to the Abbey
of Canonleigh (until seized and sold by a later King Henry).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

river flowing through Broadclyst and Rockbeare called the 'Columbe' and hence
that family name of Colunbiere/Columbeare  now seen more clearly as English (not Norman) and
places the son Elias and the next generation more  reasonably into

de Kilmington), we have noted that an early family named 'de Kilrington' (so spelt) were fittingly also established   <u>at Broadclyst</u>   and so likely accounting for some of the
Churchill's earlier, if limited, estate there.  And, our assumption that the
Churchill holdings in Braodclyst and Rockbeare, may have been geographically quite close, has recently been further confirmed in an early map of the area. The London Road between Exeter and Honiton (on the way east to Dorset)
passed directly by 'Rockbeare Court' and hamlet on its right (just into Rockbeare parish ) and, of the 5 miles northward
from there comprising neighbouring
Broadclyst parish, the manor or farm lands of 'Churchill' were noted to be about a mile to the north across that same road (being now the division between those two neighbouring parishes).
The Churchills thus appear to have been
seated there for a considerable time before 1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">400 (</b>now possibly from ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1070) </b>- and would continue to do so, mainly in Roackbeare  - as
noted. We have also since spotted a Wikipedia entry for a 'Little Churchill Farm House' very near where Rockbeare Court would be; it is now a Grade II listed
building. The main Churchill manor house <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">across
the road   in Broadclyst itself</i> (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1100-1500,
</b>say) would likely have had a <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> larger</i> Churchill Farm, and Manor House, nearby - presumably now long gone - but with
the immmediate district still shown on a map as 'Churchill' - with no hill in
sight.         <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Thus, when younger son William (b ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1490</b>) was ready to marry, a union would
be sought with the daughter of a family with some, albeit lesser, property to
combine (in value) with whatever, if any, William himself may have been provided   as a second son    by his father - from elsewhere. It appears
that some such property <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">was</i> available
- possibly via Mary Creuse's inheritance
(if now in the Churchill's gift) located
further east   near her father's residence at Weycroft Castle (just a little
north-east of Colyton and Axminster, Devon - and very near that county's
eastern border with Dorset. The de Broke
family (as a Lord George Cobham) held
the chief manor there in the early <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b>s. This is not that far from Catherston, Dorset (held by the Wadhams) -
located just 3 or 4 miles south-east of
Wycroft   over the county border into
Dorset - near Lyme Regis. <u>Our
Churchills seem to have settled there initially </u>(as referred to in various
earlier accounts) when first in <u>west</u>
Dorset by virtue of these family
connections. What Churchills, we wonder,  were then extant in Dorchester (or Corton/Waddon)
in <u> east</u> Dorset as early as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b> or before, and from what line of Churchills did <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><u>they</u></b> descend ?

said to have died as late as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1583</b>   some
miles further  east  in Dorset    in the parish of  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Piddlehinton,

unlikely. He left no Will (located thus
far) and the  relevant parish registers
or Bishop's Transcripts (if yet made) seem not to have  survived.  He likely had a second or third son
William Jnr and the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1583</b> death may possibly
have referred to him instead.  We must
stress that this account of William Churchill Snr and his assumed progeny is
based on a number of disparate sources the veracity of which all require
confirmation. Reliable documentary
evidence would appear to be very sparse, however. But first:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">             At
this point, we conveniently  pause again to take stock and  re-orient ourselves  in order to establish a new perspective on the subsequent Churchill family.  It
seems we  should  re-trace our steps from  remarks made  by the earlier Winston Churchill in his
initial account    in two respects. Firstly, when he described the location of
the earlier  settlement of the family at
Churchill  in Somerset<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">
</b>(where the main manor of the Churchills, so named,  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">appeared</i>
initially to be located  and, secondly,
when he spoke of the assumed loss of <u>tha</u>t manor (apparently) by an
earlier Churchill - which was then, at
some point,  acquired by one  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Nicholas
Megges, </b>when he married Jane Peverell (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1540-45</b>, say)<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">. </b>  Nicholas  was believed to have subsequently died<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">  <u>before</u>
 </b> Jane  - who,
as  generally reported, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">only</b>
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">then</b> married, <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">secondly</i>,  our <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Roger Churchill</b>,   in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1555+, </b>say    from whom the  Churchill line of our prime interest was
understood to descend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> By this unlikely means, Roger  allegedly re-gained  possession of that  original Churchill manor (seemingly in Somerset)   as described
above - when a possible brother John would become the ancestor of the other branch
of the family   to apparently reside eventually
at somewhere understood to be 'Munston'
in north Dorset   not too far from and
contemporary with where Winston's father (and Winston himself)  would themselves reside  (at Wooton) - as descended from Roger   that
John's elder brother.  There had, in addition, been suspicions that  Roger had lost the earlier estate  (held by Megges)  but when
the latter man died, Roger  then  married Megges' widow Jane  and thereby re-gained it. Quite inconsistent with all this however  was the idea that  Roger's  and Jane's grandson Jasper Churchill was  subsequently  employed by the Megges - as a Blacksmith. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   But, these events, and the Megges connection, turn
out<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> not</b> to have occurred with
respect to that<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>seeming<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> first </b>Churchill manor - in the <u>north
Somerset</u> area     at all,  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">nor</b>
to  one wrongly assumed to be in North
Dorsset - at 'Munston' either  nor even
at an<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">other</i>
and actual Churchill manor, established later in <u>south</u> <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Devon (</i>at Broadclyst or Rockbeare)  !  Moreover, it also appeared, importantly, to necessitate a reversal of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">the order</b> in which Jane Peverell  married her two respective husbands - and to
have done so in fact,  <u>in a quite
different locale</u> -  namely, more to
the south east   in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"><u>south Dorset </u>- </i></b>near, but not in,  Dorchester<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">;
  </b>that
is, in neither<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>north <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Somerset</i> n<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">or</b> in north or south <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Devon</i>
- both further  to the west! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Moreover, any confusion,
'shadiness' or disquiet arising during this ambiguous period (as implied by
Winston) is only compounded  when we find
in the genealogical literature differences of view regarding who was <u>the
eldest son of William and Mary</u> (nee Creuse) - once the family concerned had
left Devon, and later Catherston,  in
west Dorset    to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">apparently</b>
settle  eventually  at what turned out to be one or other of the  manors of  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><u>Muston</u>
</b>or<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> <u>Pulston</u>, </b>further
south-east<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>nearer  Dorchester in Dorset  (and thus <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">not
</b>at any more north-westerly location  -
called, if similarly <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> </i>(in the former case), <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">Munston    </i>as Winston wrongly
understood and assumed. He seems in fact
to have had no inkling of  where the brothers Roger and John Churchill may
have derived  from   if not north-west
Dorset nor, before that, from the
original Churchill manor in north-east
Somerset. Nor did he have any idea who
their father may have been (as a William Churchill of Roakbeare, next to
Broadclyst, in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">south Devon</b>). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  The foregoing  is rather a lot to take in  and re-orient ourselves about. Winston had seemingly confused various
disparate elements (people and places) of the events described     with  dates  and place names  necessarily wrongly approximated as well. And while <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Muston</b> <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">would</i>, much later,
become a property sold to <u>the later <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Dorchester</i> Churchills</u>, it is
possible that it too became confused with a similar manor called <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><u>Pulston</u></b> in a neighbouring valley
(of the Cerne) at the time of the Dissolution (and sale) of the Monasteries ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535-45</b>.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   Thus, neither
the Somerset nor the Devon  Churchill manors  were the site where the
alleged events involving Roger, Jane, Mathew   or Nicholas Megges, unfolded. They had, rather, occurred <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">only</b> further east   in mid-<u>south Dorset</u>
- <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">after</b> the younger Rockbeare son <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William</b> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Churchill</b> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Snr</b> (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1490   ?1583</b>)  seems to have  migrated  to <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">there</i>
(with his young family) - via Colyton, Catherstone and possibly Bradford Peverell, near
Dorchester, ultimately by the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1530-40s</b>,
say. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Pulston</b> manor (a later-appreciated possibility) was just to the
north of the latter   in the neighbouring parish of  Charminster.    [I believe that makes 3 or 4 necessary changes
of tack in our perspective.]   And while a John Churchill could well be the <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">ancestor</i> of the later Churchills of nearby
Muston (via Dorchester earlier),  he had
himself never settled in the latter - but did so instead only in Dorchester
itself - seemingly around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538 -40, </b>while his elder brother Roger
had likely done so at nearby <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Bradford Peverell</b>, a little north of
Dorchester (and nearer to said <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Pulston)</b>,
where their father William and younger sons <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">may</i></b> well have
settled a little before that).  But the latter certainly needs confirmation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">    In addition (as we have often alluded ,
William  didn't arrive there from  a<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> Somerset</i>
manor either (as Winston seems to have implied)  but, rather, from that  manor  in
 Rockbeare ,<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

 (A much l<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

with different orders in which  Jane  nee Peverell married her  two husbands
- in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b> (to Roger) and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553 </b>(to

<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Broadclyst</b>).  And, it was that  same one family from which <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">both</i> Roger and his younger brothers John

longer   until some uncertain date later   nearer <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535-40</b>, say).  Moreover, there has been some evidence that

or litigation documents seem to exist to  help resolve or confirm this - although
circumstantial evidence accrues in respect of sales of properties overseen by the Dorset agents of Henry 8<sup>th</sup>'s
Secretary   Cromwell - associated with the
Dissolution of the Monasteries   around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535-45
- </b>to be described later<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">.</b>  [Any
Catherston documentation (as pertaining to  the Wadhams) for that period (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1530-40</b>s) would also be most helpful.]  We have had a kind of mini-breakthrough in
this regard however with the discovery of a history of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">the ancient(ex-Norman) Bartlett/Bartelot  family</b> which describes certain of  their  activities  in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540s</b>
in regard to  the sudden availability of ex-Monastery
properties    for themselves and their various friends, relatives  and inter-related Dorset families. This is to be analysed extensively  below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">                     _ _ _ _ _ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

throughout the country, even before the Norman conquest, the great many documents
for which are now indexed on-line within the National Manorial Register.  Sadly, Pulston or Muston manors in Dorset are
not amongst   them (although we have more recently noted that 6 such  early documents for Pulston <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">are </i></b>held by the Dorset Record Office
- but only for the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1470</b>s).  There is also a
property litigation document (C / xxx)
in respect  of  it  dated
15xx)  Ironically, Munston (Manston) manor
(also in Dorset, but to the north-west) <u> is</u> shown    but with only one surviving document; (and
there were two other <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Muston</i> manors   one in Yorkshire with only two documents and the other - intriguingly also in Dorset
(to confuse matters) - at 'Winterborne
Muston' some 5 miles south-east of  Piddlehinton).  About a dozen small villages in
that area running west to east  have a 'winterbourne'
running through them; this is, a small stream that disappears in the dry summer
and only exists during the winter - as a small  winter 'bourne'. There are thus many such hamlets with
this as part of their name;  A small manor called Muston was located in one
of them. But the main manor of Muston
(sometimes called 'Musterone') and quite unrelated, was located some miles
north-west of that minor manor.         <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">            In any case, the Manor records for  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Piddlehinton
Manor</b> (which, as we believed,  could well
have included records for that larger Muston manor also),  <u>are</u> available - but, for some unknown
reason, have apparently  been long held  in the Library archives at Eton College, near
Windsor, Berks (where, quite coincidently,  two later Churchill sons attended ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1700</b>
and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1745</b>). Such manor documents generally cover all the
usual categories   of Rentals, Terriers, Court Books and CopyRolls, etc.
with good coverage throughout the
significant <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b>s. Do they show <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">any</i> Churchills there as holder or even tenants,
one wondered - under the previous Freeholders (possibly the Bartlett family, as I once noted en  passant)   around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1530</b>-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">50 ?</b>   I have
written to the Eton Archivist making
enquiries. Results, if any, will be placed here in due course: [The archivist was most sympathetic but
explained that she worked on her own there and it would likely be months before she could examine the records concerned
- even if simply to determine if any Churchills were involved in that one Manor
in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b>s. But, she said, I  was welcome to visit to make this search
myself.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

discover that while the records there did indeed cover the manor
concerned (Piddlehinton) very
thoroughly, they <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>didn't cover or include</u></i>
(whatsoever) <u>any</u> records for its neighbouring  '<u>manor of Muston'</u>  which, while also in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>the</u></i></b><u> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

(as was that same-named  'Piddlehinton <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">manor'</i>), wasn't itself <u>a part of that latter manor</u> -
but was in fact a quite separate manor (basically a large Farm with a quality
house), albeit  also located in that same large civil  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">parish</i>
(at its southern end), along with or
near two large fields called North and South Nouvard). The records for <u>Piddleninton</u> <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">manor</i> itself however  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>were</u></i></b>   at Eton
because that manor, along with hundreds of others, was, during and before the reigns
of Henry V and VI, held by various
religious authorities (Priories) <u>in France</u>   to where their annual profits
had long been  sent. Henry V (then at war with France - as at  Agincourt) decided that these monies should in
future stay in England, so he transferred their ownership Leaseholds) to
English Priories - from which rents he  financed (endowed)certain new Colleges, as that at Eton    about  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1460. </b>Its trustees then<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

any given manor had then to keep records (Court Rolls) showing the rent paid 
by any sub-tenant Copyholders   to  be collected annually by the relevant Official
of the new Landlord - Eton College.  Sadly,
<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> </i>neither

sometimes easy to forget that at this period, as earlier, a young man of any

And, because of  primogeniture, the elder son in that <u> prior</u> generation - as Thomas  Churchill Jnr (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

(Thomas Snr)'s estate back at Rockbeare   quite intact (including any gained earlier from the Tylles) - once the younger Thomas had inherited.  Once
married (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1510-15</b>. say), THomas  would likely remain on the family estate at Rockbeare and Broadclyst  (with

at one time in the west country (including in Colyton,  and  Cathesrton,

 Support for this idea comes in a Footnote
in Coxe's account where he notes that -we have located proof that the Churchills
at that time -.had alliances with both the Creuses and the Tylles   with whom
the Wadhams, Lords of Catherston (and virtually of Baronial status)  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">were  also connected in marriage</i>'</b>. [Yet  to  be

have  first settled in Dorset (as noted

source ? (This was presumably after that  briefer stay  near Colyton
-  in south-east Devon    where William  was first described  as being a Copyholder - ie holding, managing
and/or  working land held by Copyhold,
not Leasehold or  Freehold, and thus having  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">to pay</i>
some annual  rent for same (rather than
collect rent  from other tenants for his

and styling would presumably have to be
that of Yeoman, therefore,  at that
stage.  His presence in such a position
should be shown on the relevant Copy
Rolls for the Manors concerned. Where are they ? Were the Wadhams  the Freeholders ?  Or ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Yeoman</b> !   Our initial feelings (later reversed)   that the early
Churchills 'had probably emanated from
'solid Yeoman stock' - somewhere in the border lands between Dorset and Devon
 turns out  to have almost  been the case !  But that would not  reflect a stepping stone in their otherwise gradual and progressive advancement  from more modest <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">beginnings,</i>  but rather simply a  necessary 're-grouping' or
side-step   by a second son (William)   after the contingencies arising from primogeniture (in Rockbeare); that is,  in an<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> already (</i></b>and long established)<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> <u> landed</u>  family</i></b>   of Gentry and/or Esq status.  Thus, the references just above to having to
pay rent for (and working or managing)  <u>Copyhold</u>
 land,  owned by others,  rather than  generally leasing or renting <u>out</u> their <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">own </b><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> Freehold</i> land  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">to</b> others (tenants) appears
to have been the case - at least for a time. The  Churchills had  indeed been (and would continue as) a 'landed' family   virtually from the start
- but with one or two such 'rocky' phases along the way    especially for certain younger sons.  But, they seem to have had  remarkable resilience and stamina   to
stay afloat and effectively 'win out in
the end'. We shall see below that this may have entailed receiving a helpful 'leg
up' by their good friends the  Bartletts
- as  regards such as<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

bought out smaller landed Gentry (and Esquires) who had found themselves in debt through unpaid loans and mortgages taken out in 'hard times'
(as during the Civil war).  Eventually,
the Bartletts of Piddleton (and Muston)  may have been in this  position themselves - and thus this
branch of  the Churchills would gradually rise again, by purchasing this Freehold manor
from them (rather than 'simply' gaining same as a reward for aiding a country's conquest). Enquiries about purchasing had apparently
begun as early as the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1580s</b> (as we've now noted above) but,
for whatever reason,  took much longer to
finalise - in  about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1612</b>. [As also already
noted, this proved to be by a later  John
Churchill (bn ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1568</b>)     <u>of
the Dorchester branch</u> - as Roger's apparently senior Bradford Peverell line  were having their own problems  before that   with  the
early deaths of  both elder son Roger and
his only son Mathew    around the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1550</b>s. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

bought their own (ex-religious) property in the town (not a Manor) - likely at
a bargain price   and soon re-joined the Gentry  almost from the start.  Such assistance may very well have come to the aid of both branches  of the Churchills at about that same  time
(ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535-45</b>). It seems possible that the Churchills generally
had also gained equity in several disbursed properties elsewhere <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">from that time</i> and, along with arranged
marriages, soon  provided younger members
with initial footholds - even if  entailing  some  temporary
mortgages and debts initially.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 Corton  and quite possibly in the nearby Cerne and/or  Piddle valley areas.  There would thus soon  be more Churchill issue born and raised in all these new mid- and south-east Dorset centres.
  It
 was however later realised that there
were  soon pockets of Churchills in such
as West and East Compton and  in Muckelford
nearby - not far from Bradford Peverell,  as well as a John Churchill serving as a Bailiff
 in Dorchester somewhar earlier - in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1525 </b>which may well muddy our waters  a little. To whom were these l;atter Churchills born, one

survived out of their earlier possession of Corton  manor (near Waddon and Corfe Castle).   Who

 Stuart (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

 producing any noteworthy descendants ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500-1800+</b>   of which we are aware.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

paraphrase) Coxe at  about  this point: -William and Mary had  at least three
sons  Roger, John and William. As two of the younger of these, John and William, are not directly connected
with our major concern (the descent of Marlborough from Roger), we shall only
observe, before concentrating on Roger and his senior line, that the first of these two younger sons,
John of Dorchester (born ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1518</b> as
we have estimated)  obtained from this
father  William Snr - bn <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1490</b>)   the manor of Corton (possibly only transferred as Leasehold), 'that ancient possession of John
de Courcelle'. [Just if and how William
(out of Devon) would be given  any rights
or control over Corton (from ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1520</b>,
say), as a second son,  seems most uncertain.]
  In any
case, his second son John  later had some
connection with same and, by Edith Bond, left two sons William (born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541</b>) and John (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1547</b>) - again as estimated.  This
latter William would inherit the Dorchester property while John, the younger
son, seems to have gained further control of Corton. He had
only two daughters, Anne and Elizabeth,  (by
whomever)     by whose later marriages the Churchill's
property there would  be conveyed out of
that family's ancient control  into  that of these other local families:  [What
about neighbouring Waddon ? Had they
lost or sold  it earlier ?]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Thus Anne, the elder girl  (b <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1576</b>) married Maximilian Mohun of nearby Fleet, Esq
 (about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1595</b>) and so  Corton was thereby
conveyed to that equally ancient family, while younger daughter Elizabeth married Brian Williams, Esq. (of
Herringston?) - for whom no named property
is  mentioned.  He goes on to describe the Wills of this younger son John - then described as   'of
Corton, Gent' (written in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1599</b> and
proved (apparently)  in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1600</b>) and that of his older
brother William (born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541</b>) - by then also  'of Dorchester, Gent' (said, oddly,  to be have been written much earlier, in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1559</b>, but not proved until <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1602</b>   when he too died.-   He may
have been the William who sought in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1586</b> to buy those two fields near
Muston - if it wasn't in fact his older same-named uncle William Churchill Jnr (
born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1525</b>) who did so.   There seems to be no evidence.    <o:p></o:p></span></p>

events for that  next, apparently younger,
<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">third</i> brother - William Jnr,  he seeks firstly to  inform us that these two younger alleged brothers
of Roger    John and William (in that
order of birth) - have  often been confused
by genealogists in regard to where each first settled    with  the younger John (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

the brother who settled  into  and  bein
described as  'of  Dorchester'   and the elder William (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541</b>)  being later described as being  'of  Corton',
 whereas, said Coxe, it was actually 'the other way around'  (as we have just described  above)   So, 'Yes',
such confusion seems indeed often to be the
case   for two such Churchill brothers, so named-.but,  sadly, Coxe seems himself to have been confused
as to  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">the particular generation</i></b>
to which  these two brothers, so named
and otherwise confused,  actually belonged
!   <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  He was not in fact describing the  two <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">younger brothers</i> of Roger   ie John and William - said
to be born in that order in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1518</b>
and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1522</b>, respectively (after Roger),  as he
seems to have believed  (with Roger
himself assumed to have been born around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1515</b>)
 - all to William  Snr of Rockbeare (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1490</b>), but, rather, he was in fact describing  the  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">subsequent and younger two sons</i>   of  that elder William's second  son <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John
Churchill</b> (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1518</b>)  (apparently being  Roger's next younger  brother). This  latter John  Churchill was  'of Dorchester' (from at least ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538, say </b>) and it was<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> his</i></b>
second son    John Jnr (b. ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1547</b>)   who was properly described
later as  being 'of  Corton'
(however acquired) ,  and that John Snr's
 f<u>irst</u> son William (b. ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  This  may well account for  the confusion mentioned;  two sets of same-named brothers - but each
set being of different generations (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">and</i></b> orders of birth therein)   could
well be <u>the source of much confusion</u>  in regard to the dates of several events of
their respective lives.   Indeed,
it seems that while the two brothers in the earlier generation were born   as
second and third sons (after Roger)    to
William Snr)   those of this next, and younger, generation (born to Roger's
younger brother John Snr)   who arrived
in the <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">other</i> order - with a William
born first (c <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541</b>) and  a John (later of Corton) only second (c<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1547</b>) - to that  John Churchill Snr (b ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1518</b>).  But which William Churchill
and which John Churchill wrote the two Wills ascribed to these same two
oft-repeated forenames    and of which
generation   in that essentially Dorchester branch of the family?  Their respective dates and Will details will presumably provide the
answers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

normal">1538-40 </b>, say, his son Mathew's birth about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1545</b>, a daughter Margaret's about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1550 </b>and  his own early
death ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1552</b>,  one had originally written
that:  -Roger's (younger) brother John Churchill soon had  3 children himself - (quite likely in
Dorchester) with Edith (nee Bond). These were  William (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541</b>),
Elizabeth  (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

- born during this same period <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541-47</b>
before he, their father,  too would die quite young - in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1557</b>  (aged only 38 or so).  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">His</i>
Will was written and proved that same year. In  it, he refers to his two sons
- William (bn ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1541</b>) and John (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1547</b>), and their sister Elizabeth   born

Snr in conversation with one of his own father's
better off friends   either in Devon or Dorset, around 1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">535</b>
or so   discussing possible marriage
partners  for his two eldest two sons -
Roger and John.  But, of course, we have absolutely no details concerning this other than assuming it likely did happen and
that it resulted in introductions and negotiations with, respectively, the mother and step-father
of Jane Peverell - sole heiress of
an ancient landed family  (in the case of first son Roger)  and likewise with the parents (and especially
the father) of Edith Bond  - a daughter of one of the ancient Bond
families of Steeple in east Dorset. Such
a meeting could well have taken place in the main town in the area - Dorchester
- by way of mutual acquaintances,  as in
the Cloth trade in Dorchester and/or Exeter.                         <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   Roger
Churchill  thus married Jane Peverell (of
a clearly landed family - then of Bradford Peverell and elsewhere (as Baldolfston nr Piddleton) about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1536-37</b> (as estimated) while his presumed slightly younger brother John would do so in Dorchester - when,
as noted, he married Edith Bond  at about
the same time (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538-39</b>). One would assume that the latter marriage
would entail less valued property 'arrangements' (for a second son) than elder son Roger would expect, and attain (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">if</b>
the  birth order as presumed here is
valid).  Indeed, this would be consistent
with Roger (not John) being the elder son and thus marrying <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">a sole heiress</i> of what <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">seemed</i> then a considerable landed estate (manor). Edith's  branch of the Bond family didn't appear to be
quite as well off - possibly only renting at Herringston  (but the senior line of that family <u>were</u>
(<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">later) </i> quite well off   from both the Cloth trade and
gaining certain properties, apparently).  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> The boys' presumed father William Snr
and the rest of the family would likely remain for some time (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1540</b>s to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1560s </b> at such as the Muston or Pulston manor farms
on  their  presumed Copyheld land (after leaving Catherston, say). The futures of any other sons (and maybe
daughters) are sadly unrecorded in
church or manor records - which seem not to have survived.  Again, we accept that the Lowman family nay
have been the major  Copyholders   at
Muston, at least  over an unknown later
period. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Many families based on inherited
property in the countryside - before
Elizabethan times   relied mainly on
rental income but where a larger town or city (as Dorchester, Exeter, Bristol,
Sherborne or, even London) was nearby and developing, younger sons, if sufficiently-educated, often
made their way more lucratively there 
in commerce, government or the
professions   as the 16th and 17th centuries unfolded. Roger Churchill's apparent younger brother
John and his issue followed this latter route   in Dorchester<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> town</i> and, through businesses   in
Drapery, Clothiery (including Cloth  per
se) and possibly in Brewing, gradually acquired status and financial
security, reflected in purchasing
property, marrying well <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">and</i> becoming elected to such positions as
Bailiffs, County High Sheriffs, Local M.P.s. and with at least one a Barrister and another a Priest. We shall describe further details of this Dorchester
line as descended from John later (see pp 90-112). But, on the contrary, we have next our p<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">rimary</i> family of focus   out of town -
disrupted as it may have been from any smooth sequential progress, (compared to that of the Dorchester <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">town</i> branch). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> These apparent facts, including
details of the relevant marriages
(possibly passed down in the Churchill family archives or by word of mouth) are
not always verified in parish registers (often lacking) or other written documents. There is one Internet site which indicates
that Roger Churchill and Jane Peverell may have married in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Sherborne</b>   in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b>   and have their issue there. This is quite conceivable if one or other of
Jane's parents (a William and Jane Peverell - she nee----) had died young and she was brought up in some relative's or step-parent's home - in such as Sherborne (a town comparable to Dorchester but smaller   some
miles north) - with her inherited estate
at Bradford Peverell possibly managed in
the interim by some Copyhold tenant. I
believe her mother and new step-father did live more in that northerly direction, or  even  in
Wiltshire, ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1530-40</b>, than in or near
Dorchester. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         Roger and Jane could at most have
had but one other child after Mathew -
in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1550</b>, say. Indeed, some pedigrees do show a daughter <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Margaret Churchill</b> born to them; and
such a birth in that latter year seems more reasonable than one a full decade later (as shown on some sites, unless it was a much delayed baptism). For one thing, this Margaret Churchill married Bartholomew Olde - on 21 June <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1574</b> <u>in Sherborne</u> and by him
had issue there - the first in May
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1575</b>, I believe. Had Margaret been born as late as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1560</b>, she'd be but 14 at her marriage. It seems much more likely she was born in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1550</b>  therefore - not long before her father's early death in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1552</b>, as estimated. [The <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1550</b> birth date could easily have been  mis-read and/or wrongly transcribed at some point - especially as '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1560</b>'.] She and Bartholomew had issue Sybil, John and William  all, including Margaret, referred to as still living as per their father's  Will in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1595</b>. Who arranged their marriage, one wonders ? What
did Margaret bring to the union ? Her mother Jane was still alive in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1574</b>. Was her step father-in-law, Sir John Mervyn, a factor at that point ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> But, in any case, no other earlier issue is apparent from Mathew's and Margaret's clearly fertile parents (Roger and Jane) - thus further
confirming that Roger was indeed most <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>unlikely</u></i> to have been a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">second</i>
</b>husband to Jane - ie post-1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">554</b>,
say   especially with Lawrence Megges so often shown as  born to her and (actual <u>second</u> husband) <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Nicholas
Megges)</b>   ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553/4</b>. Roger was clearly her <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">first</b>
husband therefore - before dying
young by about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1552 </b> and so
producing only those two, earlier born, surviving Churchill children. [One did wonder if this couple may have had an even earlier child ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1538-42, say, </b>who died in infancy.]  As
noted, the large town of Sherborne - a little north of  Bradford Peverell - was mentioned in some
pedigrees in respect of Roger and Jane,
and their issue (re baptisms, burials, and possibly even their marriage); Fonthill Gifford in Wilts
was another possibility - her step-father's and mother's known abode ). There
was an important School and Hospital in Sherborne from the early <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b>s. Might Jane's parents or
guardians have lived there - as would
daughter Margaret   who did herself
marry and have issue there at least - if
later ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Promisingly, Sherborne's registers
are shown as complete from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538</b> and
are available on-line (through the Dorset Historical Centre in Dorchester - but
via Ancestry). They are not very legible
however. Oddly, no Will or
Administration is apparent for Roger. Jane would soon re-marry -
to Nicholas Megges, said to be of Downham (probably the one in the
Cambridgeshire Fens, although there is
another in Kent) - in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553</b>,
as estimated. She soon had her first
(and possibly only) child by him  a
son, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Laurence Megges</b>, within that year, seemingly  likely  in Bradford Peverell where they settled. But, again, there
appears to be no baptismal evidence corroborating these dates although the dates of Lawrence's own subsequent marriage and children seem to fit this estimation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Jane had no other issue with
Nicholas (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1555-60</b>, say) when she
would still be only 35 or so. And, most
oddly, her death   in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1578/79</b>   was
registered in the register for the neighbouring parish of Charmnister; another entry in her own church's register  at Bradford Peverell was rather ambiguous in this regard. The death and burial for Nicholas, only a few months later, was however only registered, as would
be expected, in 'the register for Bradford Peverell, the manor of which he was
now deemed 'Lord' - as would be his son Lawrence Megges, in turn. What was <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Mathew
Churchill</b>'s status then   in this
respect ? Where was he ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> We are not aware how the property
arrangements concerning Bradford
Peverell on Roger's marriage (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538-40</b> or so) would be affected by his
early demise   just 10 or 12 years later. There were of course now his two young Churchill children
to consider, as well as Jane's future welfare. What would Matthew's inheritance rights be ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1552</b>
 <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">before</i>
his mother Jane re-married ?         The
Megges were a family, originally from Kent (with clergy members seemingly
associated with the Cathedral in
Canterbury), who later settled in Ely
(with its comparable Cathedral), <u>in the distant  Fens</u>. We don't know how they (or specifically Nicholas Megges) became
thus involved in the future of a widowed
heiress in rural south Dorset. How
would he, seemingly in the distant Fens, become aware of her first husband's recent decease ? It was not uncommon in those times for such
as an uncle (ie of Jane or Roger) to instruct a lawyer friend or relative when
next in London to enquire outside the Chancery Courts if other lawyers   typically from any and all
other 'provinces' (who often congregated
there) knew of any financially suitable
second husband for a recent widow with property (and children). Or, equally, some interested bachelors
may have left such a standing enquiry. Or, did the Anglican clergy have
a 'network'; they would know very soon
when and where widowed heiresses of manorial property became available? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

parties' mutual benefit   with <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">the
upbringing and education of the children
a major consideration, </b></i>one would assume.<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"> </i> It was clearly a
practical, not a romantic, arrangement. A check of legal documents indexed on the Internet for the uncommon name
Meggs or Megges shows nothing to aid us in this regard directly except we note
that the Megges were often involved in property disputes in the Fenlands. They seemed to be a rather litigious family
often seeking to maximise financial gain and/or minimise property losses or
debts - by frequently going to law (or marrying heiresses ?). Thus, litigation between Nicholas Meggs and

family involved in the Cloth trade and
town politics. [There was however more than one Gould family
in Dorchester at that time and we can't be sure which one Mathew married
into.] In any case, was this arranged through any influence of the
cousin line of Churchills in Dorchester ? Probably.  John 1's elder son William Churchill 2 would
be about 27 by then and gaining in
maturity and thus be of likely influence to assist in such decisions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

parents, the Peverells; one had assumed that they would all be buried at Bradford Peverell. But might Mathew Churchill have been buried
himself in Charminster, a few years before his mother (this yet to be checked) - if they had jointly preferred to live <u>there</u>  in
his young adulthood rather than in his

of Dorchester, lies more or less mid-way between Bradford
and Pulston or Muston  - being thereby

registrations of Jane's death and/or burial - in the registers of neighbouring churches   may be a statement regarding the actual
burial in the other's church - of a
fairly important local personage - of probable interest to those in both congregations - and so recorded (copied) for posterity in both  registers. The Charminster register asserted more explicitly that Jane 'was buried'
on the date mentioned - but with only an
implication that she, as everyone else so registered in that given church, was indeed so buried - <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">there</i>. And the Bradford entry doesn't actually
say   'was buried' (wherever)   although
her husband's entry in the Bradford register seems to imply that his wife Jane <u>was</u> in fact buried in that
latter church (either inside it  next
to him (without inscription)   or, possibly, in the churchyard). [One would assume that Roger Churchill too
would have been buried <u>inside  </u><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">that</i> same (Bradford) church (of which associated

transcriptions of just a few of Bradford Peverell's baptisms, marriages and burials (over that 6 years period) at least provides us
with some additional information that
pertains to our earlier statement regarding the earliest members of the
Churchill family to reside in mid-south Dorset (in or near
Dorchester). For amongst those entries were several with the Churchill surname that at first <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">appeared </b> to have no <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">direct</i>
connection to the particular landed family we have been investigating - that is, as descend more certainly from
William Snr   via Roger or John - in this immediate Bradford Peverell 
Dorchester area. They could well have preceded
them there (although later information reduces that possibility).    <o:p></o:p></span></p>

hamlet, 2 miles west, attached to Bradford Peverell  and, apparently part of that <u>same one combined parish <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">and Manor</i></u> (although sometimes wrongly referred to as a
sub-manor in its own right).         These Yeoman Churchills may have originated from such as third sons of third sons, as it were, elsewhere
- as in north Devon or even Somerset,
with their forefathers gradually drifting south-east from there over some generations   a century or more earlier  and, only <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">coincidentally,
</i> settling in such as Muckleford (amongst several other places - as the
nearby 'Comptons'). That is, that one of these 'other places' just
happened to come under an adjoining manor   of Bradford Peverell - that would
soon be held - if coincidentally   by a <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Roger</i> Churchill of the more landed

recent connection with that Rockbeare area - as more recent 'cousins'. [It was new
information in this regard, as mentioned
above, that qualified our view.] If so,
they may have been effectively given a 'leg up'  with one or two small tenancies provided them
in such as Muckleford by its new Freeholder Roger Churchill - before he
died young in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1552</b> or so. Moreover,
around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540-45</b>, the Churchills may
well have been helped in acquiring Copyhold
properties in those nearby Dorset villages   as by the Bartletts (described
below).    <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that slightly later period <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1577-82,</b> for which those transcriptions were conveniently made (of baptisms, marriages and burials in Bradford
Peverell), a greater number of <u>Churchill</u>
entries were included than expected. Some

and where these s two 'camps' of Churchills, may have overlapped. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that same time. We find next the already reproduced entry for 'Mrs Jane Meggs', wife of Nicholas Meggs of Bradford Peverell, Armiger (Esquire) - March 11, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1578/79'. </b>As  noted, it  doesn't have the term '
buried' associated directly with
it, however. Next, there is an entry under 'Burials'  of 'Jane and Elinor, daughters of John Churchill and wife
Isabel', for <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1578</b> and April <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1579</b>,
respectively - they likely sisters of deceased Robert. Prior to this, there is an entry for the
marriage of a 'John Churchill (probably the same man) to an <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

Churchills living in Mickleford in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1570</b>s.
differentiated as' the elder' and 'the
younger'; they could be father and son or, more lilkely cousins or uncle and nephew.         We have already mentioned the Burial shown around this date (in Bradford Peverell itself) of Nicholas Meggs (12 Aug  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1579) -

20 year) period, (as during the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1550s-60s</b>),
say, there may well have been  several previous Churchill entries associated with Muckleford,   in the original
Bradford Peverell register. But that
register is apparently 'now'
lacking (since <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

transcribed in early west-country documents as 'Jone', 'Joan' or 'Johan(e)' (and vice versa), in this case, the lady concerned had definitely married a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John</b> Churchill - not a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Roger</b>

Draper, was settled initially into an
unknown property in Dorchester - where, ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1539-40</b>,
he married Edith, daughter of one    William Bond (shown to be of both Lutton  in more south-easterly Steeple (Isle of
Purbeck)  and also 'of Herringston' (nearer Dorchester). As already noted, John left two sons William 2 and John
2, (in that order)   with a daughter Elizabeth born between. [Just where John 1's next, younger <u>brother</u> William 1 (or Jnr) had settled seems uncertain; he may well have remained at Muston or, now, Pulston   with their father  (William Snr) - if he did indeed settle in one
such manor farm) and hadn't died earlier.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

(<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1536-39</b>)   probably under the tutelage of said
Edith's father or an older brother (Dennis Bond, a Linen-Draper) - <u> presumably arranged by John's father </u><b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William
 Snr (</b>otherwise, by whom ?).  But
this latter suggestion is never mentioned or intimated in any history or

descent has also been suggested which implies an  earlier birth   nearer 1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">510</b> than the<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">

as John Churchill - as indicated later (with no paternal identity apparent in later published
pedigrees) could well be explained by a purchase (by or for him) - seemingly
at a good discount)    of an
ex-religious property in Dorchester   possibly in conjunction with his
in-laws - ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545-50</b>). [We have later concluded that this may well have
been with the assistance also of one of the Bartlett family.] In any case, one would most reasonably
conclude that this John's apprenticeship and subsequent marriage to a Bond daughter
must have been arranged through the oversite and contacts of his apparent father <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William
Churchill</b> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Snr</b>   around the years <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1537-39. </b> How would this contact have come about ?
Where did William reside at that time ? Who did he know- and why ? No role for John Churchill's
sudden Gentry or even Esq status post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1550</b>)
is ever discussed in terms of an
apparent father William Churchill Snr - of-.wherever (or of
any other name). How odd. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> We assume that John was soon
employed as a Draper himself   under the
wing of the Bond family during the early <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b>s
and, only later, with the assistance of that family, as well as the  Chirchills and the Barrtletts, acquired that seemingly reasonable ex-Chantry property in which he and Edith
were soon able to live comfortably in some improved style (for a Draper). Such a property seems to have become available by virtue of Henry VIII's recent wholesale acquisition of all such ex-religious properties about then which were often soon sold on   to other local buyers - generally at  competitive prices). But then John died, seemingly quite young - in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1557

Dorchester to  his <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">elder

daughter of John Swayne of Blandford in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1565</b> (arranged by his widowed mother and her Bond family presumably) and have issue (see description of the
Colliton pedigree) - being the next two
sons of that Dorchester branch of the
Churchills (so named) that Coxe said he
did not intend to pursue <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">in  any detail </i>  it not being directly germane to
his <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">primary</i> goal   of focusing on
Roger's line leading to Marlborough. To
William's second son, John 2, then only
11, John 1 was somehow able to
leave another house   seemingly in Charminster, just a mile
north of Dorchester, formerly owned by one Mathew Wolfe/Wolffe,         The small manor of Corton (nearer the south
coast) must also have been somehow acquired by John 2   possibly as a Leasehold - from John 1. But how
would the latter, earlier man, himself have acquired it ? At this point, we simply didn't know but it <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">seems</i> to have been in the family from
earlier times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> [We will see later by his own Will
that John 2 somehow ended up owning (and/or able to leave) other properties as
well   in Dorchester, at Tolepuddle and
Athpuddle near Muston, and in
Corton itself, including its Chapel
. How did a second son of a second
son (of a second son) (!)   end up having so much property to leave   by a
relatively young age (52)   at his death (in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

of Dorchester seem both to have acquired property from a father who was himself but a second son, and just a Draper at that   who had died even
younger. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

daughter's marriage in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1593</b> to Maximillian Mohun (of another local and ancient landed family). As implied earlier, these Churchills who strongly appeared to
descend from William Churchill of
Rockbeare, seem to have acquired sufficient property, whether Copyhold, Leasehold or Freehold   through in-laws such
as the Tylles , the Creuses, the Peverells, the Bonds and, in John 2's case, the Collis or Collins
family - his wife being a Mary Collis. (of which surname one had never
previously heard).  But, again, we must
consider what help, if any, they may also have received from the Bartlett, Martyn or Tregonwell families (to be described later)
then distributing ex-Monastery properties to family friends ad libitum in many Dorset localities (presumably with
some 'kick-backs'?). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

when John 1 was still a youngster, aged about 7) there was already an older <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill</b> in Dorchester - listed as a Bailiff there ! [Unless he was somehow the same man - but, 'of what line ?] This would normally be someone of sufficient local standing who oversaw decisions by the Court (as the payment of fines, etc). One naturally wonders   what was <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">his</i> origin ? Moreover, could he not be the younger John (1)'s <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">father</i>
- especially as that later John would
also be elected a Bailiff in his time.
Why wouldn't a neutral researcher not
take that as the most likely explanation
?         After all, the pedigree for the
Dorchester Churchills (see elsewhere)
oddly shows no <u>othe</u>r origin for them - with John 1 simply appearing as
though a ready-made <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">young</i> gentleman of leisure   with no apparent need of a
father, an origin or an income. Or, even more radical, could he not be the
same one John Churchill born around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b> elsewhere - but, to whom ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:0cm;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         In any case, by about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545-50 </b> - the John Churchill of
Dorchester  must otherwise have done
quite well   to acquire that ex-Chantry property in Dorchester and soon buy some other rent-producing houses
there. Or had he previously received
some financial support - as from his seeming father William Snr  (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1490</b>)
 who, as we've suggested, may have arranged his apprenticeship
and marriage as well (possibly with the Bond family). But this might have shown descent from who was then a mere
Copyholder/ Yeoman - possibly not so desirable on an Armorial pedigree of Gents and Esquires pointedly
produced by the Dorchester family
later   as the impressive 'Colliton
pedigree'   for the Dorchester
Churchills (see later) descended from no described line. [Or, had the Bartletts helped out ?] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> [We may again remind ourselves
that these two later-born younger brothers John (2) and William (2) (born in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

two younger sons of William Snr - who was seemingly still a Yeoman - as of Puliston or Muston, say, with an <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">older</i> 1<sup>st</sup> son Roger (as Coxe describes
him) but in fact were indeed the two sons of William Snr's younger <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">second </i>son John Churchill (1), Draper of Dorchester (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">c1518*-</b>1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> We might, however, usefully note
here also what name John 1 give to his
first son ? And why ? It was, of course,  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><u>William</u></b>. After whom would he most reasonably have been
so named ? In most such cases, that
name choice for a first born son does indeed honour that of the new father's <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">own
father </i>(not his father-in-law). He
was, fittingly, as we have strongly implied, most likely  named after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1490</b>)   originally of the
Rockbeare family and later (a<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">pparently</i>)
of Pulston or Muston. But this seems  never
to be mentioned in typical accounts of the Dorchester branch of the family (nor
indeed does the concept 'branch' itself
appear to see the light of day there). And, if someone of same was later to buy a manor, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">why Muston</i></b> ? Whoever did, should have gained the manor
records. Can we inspect these please -
to see the name of the Copyholders  ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1530-50</b> - presumably recorded there
repeatedly  over many years. ? [If it wasn't a Churchill, it was likely members of the Lowman family.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> We may similarly re-cast Coxe's
account of those two second generation brothers  seen now more properly as sons of John (1)
Snr (the Draper). Thus, he might have more accurately written instead:<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> '-</b>because they (John and William) are

(possibly gained in part from the Bonds when John married Edith), as well as anything received
from his own father William Snr); otherwise, these overseers of John may have had friends of influence
when ex-Monestery properties were being distributed. John 1's <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">second</i>

his small manor at Corton (likely inherited earlier by his father John 1 - but,

been conveyed to him thereby (as in
Dorchester, say). John's wife Mary died
young in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1583</b> and this John Churchill  in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1599
</b>- leaving a Will. But its validity
seems to have been an issue initially,
as it was accompanied by a legal evaluation or judgement called a 'Sentence' 
published by a Doctor of Laws in London
(one John Gibson), in Latin   apparently
to establish its bone fides. It refers to the Testator of concern - 'John Churchill, Deceased' on several occasions,
as well as to his two daughters   Anne Mohun (ex-Churchill) the elder, and
Elizabeth Williams (ex-Churchill), and
to John;s older brother William Churchill (2), as well; also mentioned were about
6 or7 seeming local witnesses who presumably knew John Churchill and could verify the extent of his apparent
estate. [We later discovered the actual Will itself   now described further
below - and, thankfully, in English.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

properties. [One had hoped that a house
in Charminster, apparently left to John 2 by his father in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1557

whom we have described above as William Jnr) (nor others even younger,
including Richard, Alexander, or <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Rowland

his Will as -my brother-).         That is, whom he (William Jnr) married, if
he lived, and what if any property he
may have held - to pass on to any issue
or relatives. As mentioned, he likely
remained at Muston or Pulston manor (or
similar) and may have taken over a Copyhold on his father William Snr's death
- alleged to be as late as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1583</b>.  But, if his father had actually died rather earlier, it may
well have been this younger son William<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">
Jnr</i> (b ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1524, say</b>) who died in
that later year - having continued as Copyholder and effective Yeoman of
the Pulston manor, say - responsible for producing the accounts for
the actual Landlord (as ex-Cerne
Abbey?). A later Churchill  of Dorchester (one John (3) - William 2's first
son would finally have the funds to complete purchase of the Muston Freehold
at least - from a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Nathaniel Bartlett</b>   ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

interest or right in regard to Pulston

Dorchester Churchill who chose to purchase the Freehold of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">that particular</b>
(Muston) Manor  rather than that of any
other (of hundreds locally). Surely, there had been some <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">prior</i> family connection and reason ? .
This same reasoning might apply also to
the purchase of the associated land at Nouvard earlier (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Jnr but, rather, was John 1's first son

Churchill 3 who finally bought the
estate about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1612)</b>; in any case, the same question arises;  what brought their interest to this particular area and manor, possibly run previously by an apparently Yeomen level Churchill father whose
status in its manor records some may
prefer remained unidentified. We will see below that there was a Copyholder family named Lowman who had
equal interests and history in such as PIddlehinton and M uston manors (but
seemingly not Pulston). We must accept
that our William Churchill Snr's
position during the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540s-'60</b>s may remain a mystery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

John 2's 'Will' of ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1600</b>   before <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1818</b>   referring to the same few named
parties as we have mentioned above, although he did discern also a reference on

(born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1568</b>, say) son of the older
brother William 2, although in what context is not revealed. That latter William of Dorchester ,had long written his own Will in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1559</b> (two years only after the death and Will of his own father John 1) but oddly it was not proved (by this William's son John 3 (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1568-1621</b>)   as sole heir and

relevant Wills fully detailed. One says
'fulsome' 'but this must be qualified in
that it appears restricted to the branch
of the family settled essentially in
Dorchester   shown as emanating from the above  John Churchill.

some of my coverage   which also touched on John's line - which  may now
require further adjustment. Where relevant, there will be acknowledgement

12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">While appreciating that  the Dorchester author's remit must focus on
families of Dorchester per se first, the qualification suggested follows
immediately with  his opening
sentence: -<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Passing over the earlier descents</i></b>, we come to the following line of descent: 
- (ie for this Dorchester branch of the
Churchill family   .namely that descending from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 'John Churchill of Dorchester, Esq (</b>ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1512 -1557)'</b>   and the following
10 generations of his direct descendants.  These aare centred essentially on Dorchester, and later on Muston (a manor in Piddlehinton parish) a little s to the north-est.  It  is first  explained that<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> '</b>this (Colliton) pedigree is based on<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> </b>a wide range of sources, many of which will be  listed in Notes at the end'. It is also pointed out that there were many temporary inhabitants (of Dorchester) with the surname
Churchill not directly associated with the settled family in Dorchester (on which
he will focus) but whose records have been cross referenced - to
aid research into their origin as well. He has not however (he notes) attempted research himself
into same    'much beyond <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">their</i>
time <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">here</i>'.  [This
sounds similar to those uncertain Churchills of Muckleford and of East Compton,
Dorset   enquiries regarding whose
origins we too will presently leave in
abeyance.]<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

origins, we find that this too has, for some reason, <u>been <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">totally</i></b> 'passed over'</u> and not further addressed whatsoever  even
'en passant'. It is thus oddly identical to the start of 'the Colliton pedigree' (of Dorchester
Churchills) apparently produce by a later member of that family (by ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1600-1700  </b>or so, as roughly estimated). Still, it serves our purposes of providing
useful insight into the Churchill line that we take to have descended in parallel with that branch from Roger and Jane   at least over
the earlier period   from about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b>
to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1700+</b>. After that, both lines continue to impress
with their varied achievements, if relatively independently. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pedigree thus again commences rather in mid-air - without showing <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">anything whatsoever</i> regarding where John
Churchill (d. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Dorchester almost as a ready-made property-owning young married Draper, soon elected a Bailiff - from ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b> - other than being given a rather early estimated year of birth   of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1512 - </b>at<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> </b>somewhere unknown, to someone unknown, of unknown  previous standing or education or traininng.<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b> In particular, he is shown as having no
siblings, no father and no explanation
of how or by whom his apprenticeship, or marriage, may have been arranged - seemingly with the local Bond
family. Within a few years, he has
somehow managed to purchase an ex-Chantry
property by the mid to late  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b>s
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b> (and thereby presumably acquire Gent status   and develop a home on it - significant enough to be given
its own name - Colliton House.  Unless he was the sole Draper in town, one

still comparatively young. Who and where
were his father or  older siblings, for example. ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the parish of Charminster</b> (just 2 miles north-west  of Dorchester). This we found rather interesting in that the burial of John Snr's apparent sister-in-law Jane Megges (ex-Churchill; nee Peverell) was registered in the church of that
same village which, oddly, wasn't then her
own <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">home</i> village  (of Bradford Peverell)  next door. When coupled with our earlier

the latter being informed by the testator that this document was to be his last Will and Testament and that he wanted it to be 'issued and published', with witnesses (which would include
Napper). This was duly effected on 8<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> April 1599 </b>and Wm Napper subsequently drafted and signed a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Memorandum</b> confirming such (as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Willimo

years   possibly since John de Courcelle
! Who possessed such Freehold ownership or tax documents by ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Leasehold ? Possibly the other
properties referred to in the foregoing Will (as Tolepuddle and Althepuddle) were originally also part of such an
extended early Corton manor ? Who held
the implied other part of the Corton Lease? Thus, John would appear
not to be the Freeholder but only a
(partial) Leaseholder   such that some
Trust or other family branch may have held the actual Freehold in perpetuity? Consistent with this is the fact that in his
Will, John was described as 'of Corton, Gent'  not 'Esq'. He must have held only Leases in any property. [Yes; all Dorchester properties, at least,
were apparently only held as Burages  'of the Crown'.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recently arisen in this regard when it was noticed  that one of the powerful Courtenay family - with Freehold possession of much
property in Devon, also held some in Dorset, including Portisham (I believe),
much of it having been granted to them
directly from the King when the first Courtenay appears (not from Normandy in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

quite atypically; was some kind of
necessary Royal financial transaction behind all this ? They were settled initially at Okehampton Castle in Devon and
later at Tiverton Castle (previously
held by the FitzRalphs ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1100+). </b>They rather quickly became the chief
property owners throughout Devon -and

a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill</b>    but in a surprisingly early <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1525</b> - and would thus have been born  about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1495-1500,</b>
say, Where ? And to</span> whom ? <span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> [Possibly to the John Churchell of Waddon nr
Corton - his grandfather having been  there from ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1360</b>s-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1400</b>.] He is not described as related to the later  John Churchill (d <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1557</b>) - which seems odd; for
he too would become a Bailiff. It wasn't that common a surname and, as both
had been Bailiffs, both would
necessarily be of a  comparable social standing locally. In any case, the first Dorset Churchills may
not, after all, have been those descended from the father (William) of Roger and his assumed<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> younger</i> brothers -
William Jnr and John Churchill - said farther William Snr having arrived from
the <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">west</i> (with them), as we have
understood. And now, with the more
recent discovery of a John Churchill residing in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Waddon</b> in Portisham (next to Corton) much earlier, we extend this other Churchill source even
further back in history. How are they
linked ? It seems not impossible that
the 'western branch' of the family - later spreading east from Somerset/Devon into Dorset ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1520s-30s </b>(in the form of William Snr
and family), did so because of this pre-existing 'south-eastern branch'  at Corton/Waddon and ?later Dorchester (see below)   possibly with some common
denominator as the Courtenay 'Overlords' (or their successors) who may have
held Freehold properties at both Broadclyst/Rockbeare, Devon in the west <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">and</i> in Portisham and Waddon (and Tolpuddle), Dorset - more to the east !? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

 and his two younger siblings,
would presumably have continued growing
up in the Dorchester property of
Colliton House under the guidance of their mother Edith (and any new
partner). By about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1557</b>, William would have
finished his secondary education and/or
any training in the family Drapery/Clothing/Tailoring business. They
seem also to have had a little rental income from a few smaller properties already held
in Dorchester (however acquired by their father - as a Draper). William married in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1567 </b>(a
decade before younger brother John of Corton aand the above Will) to a daughter
of John Swayne of Blandford (nearer Sherborne) . They would have 4 daughters after an only son John (b ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1568</b>) who effectively thereby kept the Churchill line going in Dorchester from the age of 17 - ie effrctively by ' the skin of their teeth', it would seem). [We might suggest that the relatively late marriages
of both John Snr's two sons (William and
John) could imply that neither they nor
he were born as early as sometimes
suggested.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had himself been elected a Bailiff of Dorchester where we assume the
Clothing business continued.         Indeed,
that his only son John was also described later as a Draper or Clothier himself and it is again interesting that in his Will,
William too styled himself 'of
Dorchester,<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> Gent</i>, not 'Esq' [Now explained above]. Possibly he had divested himself of his major
property by transferring it previously to this son and heir John, leaving him
otherwise only the reminder of his
goods, chattels etc   after small
bequests to his daughters and their children. The Will was not proved until <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1602</b>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ultimately, he (and heirs)  would
become 'of Muston, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

being held as a Freehold, we assume). We note too that all the Dorchester properties sold over
the years appear to have been held ultimately by the Municipality as Burages 'of the Crown' and so only <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">leased</i> to buyers seemingly - who thus
remained or became such as  'of
Dorchester, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

having a given occupation - rather than 'Esq')         After secondary education in
Dorchester presumably (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1580-85</b>), and some time learning to be
a Clothier, this John nevertheless entered Oxford University in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1587</b> and Middle Temple in London in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1589.  </b>Aspirations were afoot. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

his father William Churchill (apparently)  purchased the land at Nouvard

any form of higher education (or the
purchasing of property)- but at least did subsequently become a trained Tailor
- around this same time (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1584-86</b>)
- quite possibly in association with tthis
cousin in Dorchester. Whether the
Dorchester John graduated from either higher education institution, or ever
practised as a Lawyer (rather than remain primarily  as a Clothier, and land-owner eventually), is
not mentioned. Once home, he would marry
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Eleanor Meller</b>, daughter of John
Meller of Little Bredy, Esq (just south
west of Dorchester) around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1597</b> and with her have a very large
family indeed   over the next two decades. [We shall find that some earlier Churchills had already resided in

have some family connection therefore ?

subsequently being influenced by this

that last point and to cover  a relevant  aspect of our story before continuing further with
the descent from Roger Churchill.  We
may usefully recall firstly the period
around the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1550s-60s </b>when Jane (nee
Peverell) had just lost her first husband Roger Churchill (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1552</b>) - and was thus left in Bradford Peverell with her two
young children   Mathew and Margaret. As previously noted, a second marriage was quickly arranged for her   with a Nicholas
Megges   by whom she very soon had a single
son <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Lawrence Megges</b> ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553</b> (but no others). Meanwhile, according to an excellent
overview of the above-named 'Connection'  by Michael Russell (who usefully posted coverage also of the Colliton Churchills of Dorchester)   a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Thomas
Devenish</b> (born about 1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">530</b>) had
somehow also acquired a little (Copyhold) land in Bradford Peverell   ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1555   </b> when aged about 25.  He'd settled
there with his wife (name unknown)
whilst studying for the priesthood. Their children, born there
between <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1556</b> and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1564 </b>or so<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">
</b> were Robert,  Agnes, William and Lawrence Devenish. Thomas was ordained a priest in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1561 </b> at<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> </b>Salisbury, Wiltshire<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>and,
conveniently, then became Curate at his neighbouring<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>parish<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> </b>of Charminster   by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1567</b>. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>Jane's two Churchill children, Mathew and Margaret, were now aged about 21 and 17,
respectively,  also residing in Bradford,
would soon marry: Mathew in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1567</b> in Dorchester - to an <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Alice Gould</b>, and Margaret in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1575</b> in Sherborne - to a Bartholomew Olde, where they settled. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Rev Thomas Devenish's eldest son, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Robert Devenish</b> (b. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1556</b>), still 'of Bradford Peverell',
would also soon marry locally    in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1573</b> - to an  Eleanor
Churchill.  Her origins are uncertain but
there were two or three Churchill families (of Yeomen status),  as previously noted, residing then in the western (Muckleford) end of Bradford Peverell - about 2 miles distance from the manor house. A later Elinor Churchill was baptised there in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1580</b>, I believe.         The Muckleford Churchills didn't appear<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"> initially</i> to be close relatives to Roger Churchill   who we've assumed came to Bradford somewhat independently and earlier , in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1535-40,</b> to marry Jane Peverell, heiress of that Manor.  This would entail acquiring  Freehold lands in various areas nearbyto
be let out under Copyhold regulations to tenant Yeomen. [As noted earlier, two of the families of
Copyholders there (the Lyes and some
Churchills) seem to have come from the Rockbeare and Aylesbeare area of Devon   <u>after</u> Roger and thus they
may well have been relations given such tenancies by him around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b>].  So, these relations may have been closer than
initially appreciated.  In any case, Robert and Eleanor Devenish had <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

Will, written 20 March, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1632/33</b>,
Lawrence Devenish, seemingly the youngest son of Rev Thomas, is described as 'of Bradford Peverell, Yeoman'. He left about 10 bequests to various relatives and friends but no
mention is made of any wife or children. To his apparent sister Agnes Lawrence, wife of John Lawrence, he
left the 40 shillings owed him by said John, to whose son Phillip
Lawrence, he nevertheless leaves 8 Pounds . To his (other?) sister Jane Bigwell , he leaves just 10 pence (or
possibly more  as it
is shown as 'xld'). [Did his father Thomas re-marry in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1565</b>,
say, and have a second daughter Jane   who married a Mr Bigwell in about<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1595 </b>or so<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>?] In any case, he also leaves 10 pounds to a John Bigwell, son of Robert Bigwell, and is equally generous to a cousin John
Tibb(s),leaving him also 10 Pounds,
along with 5 Bushels of Barley. He leaves 5 Pounds to Charity Hardy, daughter of John and Margaret Hardy, when she reaches age
18. Finally, he leaves 10 shillings to the church of Bradford Peverell and to
Thomas Kinge, Clerk, 10 pence. All other
possessions were to go to his nephew Robert Bigwell   whom he made sole Executor. It was signed by
Lawrence on 31 May <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1633</b> and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>.proved by the said Robert Bigwell. The latter man, likely born around<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1590</b>, would presumably be a son of his
'sister' Jane and her Bigwell husband, while his cousin John Tibb(s) would
be born earlier, around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1560-70</b>, say, to a sister of his father
or mother.         <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Yeomen, lived on Copyhold land (with
a house) somewhere within the parish of Bradford Peverell (probably in its Muckleford area to the west), previously held by their father  Rev Thomas Devenish, initially its senior
'tenant' and he later also the Curate  in
neighbouring Charminster. His children
were apparently added to the Muckleford tenancy Copyhold  from their respective births   likely for  lifetimes only, it then reverting to the Bradford Peverell manor  after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1633</b>. The Will was witnessed by his nephew   <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Benjamin Devenish </b>- son of Lawrence's older brother Robert
Devenish. Benjamin was apparently
brought up in Dorchester   during the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1580</b>s <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">   </b>to where his father and mother had moved about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1577</b> or so.<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Benjamin  seems to have been<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>set to an apprenticeship as a Tailor there with a
family friend or relative - around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1588-92,
</b>say<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">.</b> Because his father Robert had married a
Churchill (Eleanor) in Bradford Peverell, they may have sought a placement with a member of that same family in Dorchester, where that branch  were quite influential. And we know that William Churchill of
Dorchester (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541-1600) </b> had in fact been in the Clothing trade himself
there (his father John having been  a
Draper) and indeed William's son John Churchill 2 (bn <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1568</b>) was himself described as a Clothier. He too had probably trained in this same sphere   around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1582</b> or so - after Grammar school, and before continuing his legal education at Oxford or an Inn of Court in London  
around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1590-92. </b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Before the turn of that century
therefore, Benjamin - with such training and encouragement   would likely be
able to support himself and soon consider marriage  initially as a Tailor
but later as a man who could
reasonably be seen as an aspiring and
worthy Esq himself one day   to facilitate a marriage into the gentry. Just
whom and when he married remains unknown. However, we do at least learn
that she too was yet another Churchill   as strongly
indicated by Benjamin's eventual Will
(written in 1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">643</b>) in which he refers two or three times to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">-my
brother-in-law John Churchill - </b>and, on one occasion at least,
crucially, as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">-..John
Churchill, <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">E</i>s<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">q </i>-.</b> [Benjamin's own
styling  in the Will, however, had remained
as 'Yeoman'.] As with many of the Wills
of those days (and earlier) there is
sadly often very little reference to just <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">where</i>
various individuals <u>resided</u>. Of
all the Churchills, none had a forename more common than 'John'. But, at least the styling - ''<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Esq</b>' narrows the field considerably. But, where was that John  from ? Where did he reside ? That is, who
was he,  and who was his sister who had
married Benjamin ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Firstly, we note that John Churchill, the Clothier, had married an
Eleanor himself - she nee Meller (about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1597</b>) but she didn't go on to re-marry
(as Eleanor Churchill, widow ) to a Benjamin   after John died quite young - in
1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">621</b>. And while this latter John had  eventually
become an Esq himself (on purchasing the small estate (at Muston) in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1612</b>), he wasn't so styled when living for a time earlier in Stinsford (I
believe), just on the edge of Dorchester. And, in any case, he died <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">much too
soon</i> to have warranted Benjamin's reference  in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1643</b> to  a
'brother-in-law' John Churchill who still owed him money - 22 years
after his death !   But that John did have a large family with
Eleanor, and while one son, his 4th, <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> was</i> yet another John Churchill (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1604</b>) - of good education - he became a Priest and his styling was thus always that of 'John Churchill (of wherever), <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Clerk</i></b>',
never 'Esq' - never owning his own
estate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> And, in any case, all sisters of these two John Churchills (Esqs or
not) were accounted for in respect of
their subsequent marriages (except possibly one (a Sarah). There were also at least two earlier John Churchills settled in Muckleford
(in Bradford Peverell) but they were all Yeomen, not Esqs. Nor was there an Eleanor Churchill available
in the <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Dorcheste</i>r family (nor that of
Bradford per se) to account for Robert's wife (in 1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">573);</b> she too therefore was most likely of one of Muckleford's Yeoman families (as was the Margaret Churchill
across from whom the Devenishes apparently live earlier    in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1581</b>).         <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">But</b>, there <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>was</u></i></b>, however, one other <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill, Esq</b> - with his own
freehold property. who may well have had a sister available to marry Benjamin Devenish  around the relevant period. And he was more likely than the others to nevertheless be in need of money   not yet
re-paid by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1543</b>. The Civil war was fast developing and royalists were soon to be fined for
opposing the winning side. Yes, that other John Churchill, Esq was he of Wooton
Glanville, father of Winston   who was also about to marry   and was also in a tenuous financial
state. And let us recall that this John
Churchill, Esq was born to the elder Jasper Churchillof the<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>(non-Yeoman) <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Bradford Peverell branch  of  the manorial
Churchills - </b>from which parish the
Devenishes came<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> !</b>  One of the Churchill  daughters from that John
Churchill (of the manorial branch of the family) had  most likely married Benjamin Devenish. While Benjamin
and bothers wereinitially of Yeoman status, their father was at least a Curate
and priest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Happily, something then transpired that helps us consolidate this interpretation. It was
recorded in something called 'The
Casebook of Sir Francis Ashley JP, Recorder of Dorchester, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1614-1635'</b>   published by the Dorset Record Society in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1881</b>. One case in particular, which occurred in Sept <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1630</b>, was<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b> cited by Michael Russell in his welcome article
on <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Benjamin Devenish</b>.         On Sept 2 that year, Benjamin was in
Dorchester with two other men  called <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Burd</b>, a Farmer, and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Jasper
Churchill (!)</b>, shown as a '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Cutter' </b>(sic)<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> - 'from London'</b>. The three of them, seemingly close friends,
had become embroiled in an altercation with a fourth man, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">William Amey, </b>who had  Complained to a Constable of their
aggressive behaviour towards him. They were thus brought as Defendants before the local Recorder who concluded that they should at least be 'bound over'   to keep the peace   until the
next Quarter Sessions'. John Burd
appeared to be the major culprit (having
threatened to strike Amey with a stone, and even to 'kill him') and so
had to pay the larger penalty   of &pound;40,
while the other two paid only &pound;20
each, to ensure they did indeed 'keep
the peace', or forfeit those sums. They
must have kept the peace as, nothing further was  reported on this  matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> That behaviour of John Burd proved however to be another case of
'serendipity' for us - he being chiefly
responsible for the affray
and subsequent inclusion  in Judge Ashley's Casebook -of  the names of all three involved.  [We may recall our earlier
'serendipitous dividend' was discovered in that litigation archive (Megges
vs Lye) indicating that the Yeomen Churchills of Muckleford very likely derived from the same otherwise
landed family of Roger's father William
 <u>in or near Rockbeare, Devon</u>.] To see why this later revelation proved
equally helpful to us, we must first correct an error in that the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Jasper Churchill </b>so fortunately reported on,<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">  </b>wasn't in fact a '<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">C<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">utter</b></i>   from London', but rather a '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"><u>Cutler</u></b>' from that
distant city; although, crazily enough,
he might conceivably have actually been a 'Cutter'   if that term denoted a
specialist role for a Tailor (one who cuts out the pattern of cloth for any
given garment). For the latter man (the
actual <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">'Cutler</i> of London'), was in
fact the known son of the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">elder Jasper Churchill</b> (Snr) - who had indeed trained to be just that   <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">a
Tailor</b> - if more locally in Dorchester
 where he remained ! [One couldn't make it up.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> And thus, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">in  either case</i></b>, one might equally
have gained evidence in regard to identifying who was the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">John Churchill, Esq</b> whose
sister would (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1612)</b> marry Benjamin Devenish  being the younger Jasper's fellow companion
on that occasion in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1630</b> (and the elder one's when <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">they</i>
apparently trained (almost) together   in the late <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1580s/</b>early <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1590s</b>. In one fell swoop, we seem to have
identified the three Churchills at the centre of our mystery ! The bride concerned would of course be a sister of  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">the <u>younger
Jasper Churchill' </u></i> (as well as of
John, Esq, later of Wooton)   all born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1589-95</b>,
say) - thus making that Jasper another 'brother-in-law' of Benjamin. [Note: he was <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">not</i> of course the namesake 'Jasper Churchill' born later (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1609) </b>to John and Eleanor in Dorchester - who was neither a Cutter nor a
Cutler.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would be about 38, while his elder colleague Benjamin Devenish would be nearer
56. That he was a colleague, despite the
age difference, would be due to their common denominator of  Jasper Snr   whose funeral they may or may
not have both recently attended locally, as well as having shared memories of the family Clothing business and of
the two John Churchill Esqs (albeit of different generations) during the years around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1600
-1610, say. </b>This would likely be <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>when
Benjamin Devenish would be considering marriage <u>and the name of the sister of John Churchill Esq </u> <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">(and</i>
of Jasper Churchill Jnr) was apparently mentioned in this regard (if, sadly, not as yet privy to ourselves   with respect to her
forename). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Esq being sought, nor was his 4<sup>th</sup>
son John Churchill, Cleric (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1604-1682</b>). Iit may be noteworthy that the latter's  said father John
did also name two of his

normal">Jasper (1609</b>) and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Mathew</b>
(<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1615); </b> some mutual affection clearly existed  between the two Johns (of Dorchester/Stiston,
and of Wooton, Glanville, respectively) thereby. The other (Bradford) Churchill sequence - of 'Mathew-Jasper Snr-John-Jasper Jnr'  in the  family   was clearly within the Dorchester
branch's purview. We conclude that the 'John Churchill Esq' referred to in Benjamin's Will was thus indeed  '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John
Churchill    of Wooton Glanville, Esq'</b>   and not one of the Dorchester-based
Churchills. The common denominator was not just Tailoring but
also Bradford Peverell ! Thank you John

Bradford Peverell for Roger and, quite possibly at Pulston or some other south Dorset manor,
for assumed  3<sup>rd</sup> brother William
Jnr - with their mutual father William Churchill
Snr residing there or similar for a time, possibly as a Copyholder. But, the lack of parish register data makes all this very tentative. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and/or his sons in the growing Dorchester business(es), or with William Snr at the estate at Muston (or
Pulston, Lt Bredy, or Compton) , is
unknown. It was originally thought that
the records for Piddlehinton manor (awkwardly held at Eton College), may have finally shed some light on this period -
that is, in regard to the identity of the main Copyholder at neighbouring <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Muston</i>
manor - also in Piddlehinton  <u>parish</u>,  that early. Sadly, they didn't   as explained earlier. The archives of some ex-religious landlord
(as Cerne Abbey?) may well hold this secret
somewhere. [Eg - with the documents to be held by the eventual holders of
Muston manor and Farm..] <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

Dorchester (b. ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

in Dorchester, if aged  but 16
or so (as estimated)  living with his mother Edith and, shortly, a
new step-father. In <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Dorcherster. That is, there was in fact no family there then.  Similarly, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

younger - aged only 10 and 7  and left in the care presumably

Peverell; ex-Churchill) with, again, a new step-father   <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Nicholas Megges</b>  from ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553</b>. We can reasonably assume that they too would
receive suitable educations locally
and would later receive any additional
occupational training, if needed (when
fathers die so young), from any  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Churchill relatives</i> locally, say   from about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

the daughter  of a James Gould of a local Merchant family there, dealing in
Cloth. This union was probably arranged in part by the one Dorchester Churchill   who was of
similar status. [We note that there were
two or more Gould families in Dorchester then and Alice may not have been of
the enior one.] Mathew's sister <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Margaret Churchill</b> would, a little later, also marry - a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

(there) sons John and William Olde and a daughter Sybil   by the late <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

been arranged by her mother Jane's step-father. [Margaret's alleged birth as late
as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1560</b> (noted on certain sites) seems much less credible; the transcription of same could well have

appears later as a Bookkeeper and later still as a Draper or Haberdasher   with his own business
in Sherborne (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1590</b>) . He left a Will   dated 30 Dec <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1595 (PROB / 11 / 85 / xx</b> ) and in it, left &pound;5. to his parish Church, !0 shillings to the Poor of the town and &pound;40. to his wife Margaret (nee Churchill)- who would then be about 45. The latter sum was to be paid to her in two
&pound;20 portions: the first, one month after his decease   and the other, a year
later; he also left her his furniture, bed, blankets, etc and best Silver spoons. He left another &pound;40 also   to his younger son John, 'when he

13, say, and so born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1582</b>); this amount to him 'if still living at Bartholomew's death', but otherwise the &pound;40 to go to
his daughter Sybil. His seeming elder
son William was to receive rental income from his father's former shop, I
believe  (to be confirmed) . There was also the family's residence in
Sherborne to be inherited presumably. (Did  the Olde boys attend Sherborne school, one wonders ?) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bradford Peverell with his mother from about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

his own marriage - around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1567 - </b>when he<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

normal">1568 - </b>probably in Bradford
Peverell (but possibly in Dorchester) - who would thus be but 7 or so when
he in turn lost his own father Mathew. His grandmother Jane (now Megges) may or may not have remained. in Bradford (recall her death oddly registered in neighbouring Charminster in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1578/9</b>)   even if ownership of Bradford
manor was by now (post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553</b>) in the
hands of her <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">second</i> husband Nicholas
Megges (and subsequently (post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1580</b>)

descendants for many generations. But remaining a Churchill widow (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1552-1560s</b>, say) was apparently not an
option financially for Jane nee Peverell.   Did the
church step in to help her ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mathew, shortly to die themselves of
course - (thus reinforcing the likelihood that Jane could indeed <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">not</b> have married Roger only
secondly - ie as a recent <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Megges</i>
widow   that late). Moreover, had she
somehow done so, that would of course leave<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">
</b>insufficient time for subsequent Churchill births of Mathew, Margaret and, after Mathew married, of Jasper and various Churchill events subsequent to that - the dates for which are
much better known and reliable. Only an

Jane <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">before</i> Lawrence Megges in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553
 </b>(nor indeed afterwards, despite
Jane still being in her early 30s). By providing one male Megges heir, Jane may
have decided she'd 'done her duty' in an apparently arranged but seemingly loveless marriage).<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

? Was it in the Megges household at
Bradford Peverell, or partly with one of
their Churchill cousins or uncles in Dorchester, or even with their long-lived grandfather William Snr - possibly still at Muston or Pulston (allegedly until <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1583</b>), or somewhere nearby ? And
now, there is the possibility of a home in Charminster, just next door - which
parish, intriguingly, includes Pulston manor at its north end. We learn that the cousins of Mathew - William
and John Churchill (sons of Mathew's uncle John 1 of Dorchester, who had already died in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1557)</b>  would remain in Dorchester and Corton, respectively - in the ensuing later Elizabethan period <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1565-'95.</b> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mother (in Bradford Peverell)   held for
him in trust say   <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">before</i>
she re-married ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553</b> -
possibly as negotiated by her
father-in-law William or by  her quite
able Dorchester cousins (if still alive)? One assumes that this<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> </i>would  likely be the case and that, as a consequence,
Mathew's son Jasper (b <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1568</b>), in turn, would to some extent also subsequently so benefit, even if
indirectly. [Might they have rented, at a reasonable rent, for example, that house (ex-Mathew Wolffe's)
in Charminster - from John Churchill of Corton (in Portisham) who refers to it in his Will ?] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mathew had moved next door to
Charminster some years before (or
Pulston?). In any case, the Freehold of Bradford was inherited by the son Lawrence Megges by<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">

opening statement - viz: - I, Lawrence Megges of Bradford Peverell,
Esq, being sick of body but of sound and
perfect memory, do this present day of October in the 40<sup>th</sup> year of
the Reign of our Queen Elizabeth (ie <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1598</b>),
make and ordain this my last Will and
Testament   in manner and form following; First, I wish to state that I,
Lawrence Megges, have received and suffered many wrongs and unnatural practices
committed by my uncle Henry Megges and his sonne Percival Megges --. (!) This is followed by various barely legible
remarks regarding a Robert Miller and ends with - ...and I ordaine <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Mr William Churchill of Dorchester, Gent</b> [born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541</b>]
and his sonne<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> John Churchill</b> [born
ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1568</b>] to be Overseers of this my
Will- - signed by 4 witnesses on 15
October <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1598</b> ). Hr clearly trusted the Churchill family of
Dorchester and we would assume that his half-brother Mathew (and son Jasper)
would likely have benefitted equally from this trusted relationship as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

man, the almost immediate litigations commenced by his father Nicholas
Meggs against Bradford tenants (in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1553</b>) just after his
marriage (and earlier by his relatives in the Fens), the lack of any
inscription in respect of his wife Jane in the Church and her <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">seeming</i>
removal in any case to Charminster, all
evoke an impression (no more) of an awkward, dysfunctional family into which Jane
was somehow placed - possibly involuntarily. [We've more recently noted
reference in the 'probatum' of Lawrence Megges' Will of him having in fact been later declared a 'Lunatic'. This could imply something like intermittent
dementia or general paresis; he was only 45 at that time. It could account too for the odd public
accusation in his Will against his uncle and cousin - of 'unnatural practices' allegedly committed by them 
against him.] I hope to re-examine this
Will to better convey its details; he had several other surviving children who
one presumes were mentioned in same. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Peverell (acquired initially about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553 </b> from widowed Jane Churchill (nee Peverell). What the legal position of her and son Mathew was in relation to ownership of or benefits from that manor <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">just prior to her re-marriage   to
Nicholas Megges<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">, </b> </i>I'm unaware. The senior Megges family then collected its rental income for another two hundred years (to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1770</b>); they of course being referred to locally as
'Lords of that Manor'. [<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Who, </i></b>we

re-marriage   of Jane Churchill (nee Peverell)   to a Nicholas Megges - of the
distant Fens, rather than to a local Dorset man better known by her family
? What, one wonders, were <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> his</i> bona fides, incentive or
motivation in doing so ?] It later appeared that one of the families paying some of that rent to the Megges (possibly
'subsidised') could have been that of young Jasper Churchill   around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1600-1620</b>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

'Chaplet'. Moreover, we notice that in
an early (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1595</b>) Chancery Suit (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">C47/83</b>) concerning various
Dorset manors involving a Sir William Willoughby, one of the 9 original hamlets of Charminster was called 'Herringston; 'alias 'Little <u>Herringston</u>')

residing anywhere in Dorset, as far as I can see, there were at least two
entries for the similar name Chappell (or similar) listed in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1570</b>s
in Charminster (with its Little Burton hamlet also) )and another in Dorchester itself.  There was of course also Wolfeton/ Wolveton House in Charminster (in a neighbouring hamlet of that name) of which  the Trenchard and Mohun families (inter-married) had long been previous gentry owners.

suitable marriage partner - around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1567 </b>or

then (after any secondary education)

would thus very likely have become close (and related) friends over those few teenage years - effectively
becoming Clothiers or similar
together. But John would soon go on to
higher education in London from that point (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1588</b>) while Jasper Snr would remain at Bradford

Tailor <u>there</u> - probably within the existing Churchill business 
still run by the Dorchester John Churchill's father William and, on his
return from London, increasingly by John
2  himself. He would later live in Stinsford - conveniently mid-way between Bradford
Peverell and Dorchester. Once married
and into work himself (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1590</b>),
Jasper Snr seems to have made certain

with one Richard Ball   under the auspices of that Worshipful Company, while his slightly elder brother
John Churchill would continue his higher education - after Oxford   about
the same time, or a little later - at an Inn of Court  - to become a Lawyer. They may even have lived together there for
a time. Interestingly, these  two brothers' father - Jasper Snr - was

by about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1630 (</b>as estimated earlier<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">), </b>when aged around  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">62.</b>

initially at Miinterne Magna (on property apparently  held previously by his Dorchester cousins   from
that period of opaque Monastery land sales and transfers)  and later at  nearby Wooton Clanville, the freehold of which

his father in law John Churchill, Esq, as a Royalist had built up some debts
defending his position and had apparently borrowed some money from his
son-in-law Benjamin (by then doing quite
well in business in 'neutral' Dorchester.                     He would thus refer in that Will (see later) to  --my

</b>as estimated), presumably in either
Bradford Peverell or  Dorchester, as quite possibly would  younger brother <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

in any case,  more certainly  in Dorchester   in the
company of  Benjamin Devenish    in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Sept
1630</b>   - when they  were both arrested there together in that
altercation described above.  The two
branches of the Churchill family - of Bradford Peverell (and later of London
and Wooton Glanville) - as descended from Roger (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

each other at least until ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1640</b> or so   at  the start of the Civil  War. [Where does Jasper's Will fit in about

decline and drifting apart in their mutual contacts and the awareness of developments in their respective families' later
histories. After the War, Winston sought
(during the 16<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">50-60s</b>) to discover the background of his own line of
Churchills and seemed  strangely  uncertain of their   relationships with other branches much before
those of his own father and grandfather. While  in Dorchester and Muston,
the senior figures in <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">that</i> latter Churchill
family seem  focused more on their own local
accomplishments   unrelated to the War
or to subsequent Restoration concerns of
the Court or Government in London.  There were only two eldest sons of the Dorchester-Muston family quietly occupying
so many of subsequent decades locally -

London in July,<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1641</b>. For her children and grandchildren, the Civil War was just around the corner. At least, they (or just William?) had their properties - presumably now
including Muston Manor. Was it (or they)
profitable ? Or, did they just pay for themselves, as it were - with
Muston at least providing a family
'seat' in the country and hence the styling '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Dorchester and Muston Churchills from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1641</b> (and effectively from before that
probably) until his death in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1680</b> - being buried at Muston (where some of the family had likely
lived latterly). To what extent they still relied on the
Drapery/Clothier and/or Brewing business in Dorchester for their main income
and general position in local society,
or increasingly on rental income from
property in both Dorchester and Muston   over that lengthy and tumultuous 50 year period, I am unaware. Assuming both parents and William's siblings were by
then no longer around, the Muston family
then consisted essentially of William and Mary (nee Yarde) and<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">
their</i> family   of 4 surviving sons and 3 daughters   born in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1620s-30s</b>. They would have then lived subsequently through the Civil War, the Commonwealth <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">and</i> the Restoration periods - but
as Roundhead or Royalist supporters is
uncertain. [We know rather more about
the Wooton Glanville Churchills (as Royalists) over this same long and
significant period. I read somewhere
that Dorchester tended to cooperate with the Royalists both before and during
the Commonwealth period but essentially sought to remain neutral.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

William was credited with (re-)building Colliton House around this time
(possibly with Yarde money?) but otherwise appears to have sought to live the life of a quiet country gentleman at now family-owned Muston manor-
having only reluctantly, it was said, served as .High Constable (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1634</b>) and High Sherriff (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1640</b>) for the county before the Civil war - which would soon begin, followed
by the Commonwealth decade of the<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1650s</b>.
 William would finally serve as  Deputy-Governor for Dorchester during that latter  period. [We may recall that <u>the Royalist-supporting</u> Dorset lawyer John
Churchill and his son Winston (of Roger's line)  were still living in Dorset   at
Ashe House during those awkward times - with Fines hanging over them both. It is hard to remember that they
had descended so recently from the Roger-Mathew-Jasper branch of the Churchills of Bradford
Peverell (with some support and influence by their Dorchester cousins).  They had otherwise  lived parallel lives in south Dorset to their respective kith and kin of
Dorchester and Muston (to whom we had referred as leading 'rather
low-profile lives'; possibly this was more a function of their
more local than national focus ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</i> son John Churchill 3 (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1622-1682</b>) who, in turn,  led the latter branch of the family.    We see that no Will was left by his father William - just 2 years before John, as
eldest son, also died. The latter  was a contemporary of Winston Churchill of Wooton  (who had become, post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1660, </b> a local MP for Weymouth, and later knighted). Their 'cousin' in London, 'Sir John Churchill'   would later also serve as an MP (for Bristol). We may note that no Churchills in Dorset or Devon seem to have
served such Parliamentary roles before <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1660  </b>as in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b> Cromwell's day, or earlier.] But, over the following three hundred years, both branches of the family
would display impressive competence in many spheres of leadership and public
life - all descended it seems from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William
Churchill of Roackbeare in Devon. <o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

Dorchester and Muston estates in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1680</b> (which may well have been transferred to him previously).  He seems to have been relatively productive through the eventful times of his
long life - still with its Civil war, Commonwealth period and return of Monarchy (Charles II) dominating everything nationally. However, he sadly lived only 2 years in his recently inherited position as 'Squire' of Muston' manor (prior
to which he would have been styled 'Gent'). To what extent, if any, those national events touched life in Muston in rural Dorset, just
before this, might depend on whether one was a Roundhead, a Cavalier or
essentially neutral   and keeping that
low profile.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have any surviving issue. After the
Restoration, he became a JP and soon an
MP,  for Dorchester, in the first Cavalier Parliament (as
would Winston Churchill   for nearby
Weymouth - being the son of the other
contemporary John Churchill  (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1620-1688</b>) then in Dorset  being the recent lawyer of Wooton Glanville). He and son Winston had both been fined by the Roundheads for supporting the albeit absent King during the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1650</b>s. What fines, if any, were suffered by the Dorchester-Muston branch of the
contemporary family (as above William and son John), I'm unaware. We may recall the 3<sup>rd</sup> (Sir) John
Churchill - yet another lawyer   of London - also kept his powder dry in this regard; one assumes they would all know (of) one
another. Yet Winston appeared to have
little knowledge (or interest?) in those 'cousins' - back home. [This may require more scrutiny.]      <o:p></o:p></span></p>

purchase of properties in Dorchester and surrounding districts were revealed
much more thoroughly when I happened upon a website showing such sales as
recorded in the '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Municipal Records of Dorchester,</b> as noted above. In this, such transactions were recorded in a very consistent way over
several centuries (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1200-1700+</b>).         Typically, the buyer, the seller and the
exact location of the property concerned were given and recorded, and the names of two Attorneys who would
oversee matters, followed by the names of one or two current Dorchester Bailiffs or Constables,  plus  about 10 other Witnesses - being
trusted local citizens of some
standing. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Thus, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">the first sale noted involving a Churchill</b> was one for which a John
Churchyll was one of several Witnesses to a sale dated 1 March <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538/39</b>. I scanned backwards in time from that event for
a few years and could see no earlier Churchills involved in such sales   earlier in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1530s</b>. In the other, later direction, I soon found a John Churchill, now a
Bailiff, as a Witness in May <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540,</b> and again in June <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545, </b>as a Constable. In March <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1547</b>, he was again one of
several Witnesses, before he was noted
as a Constable again in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1549</b> and as a Witness in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1550</b>. (I noticed several men
shown similarly in these two roles (public offices) despite often being
described at other times by their actual occupations; such roles clearly weren't mutually
exclusive. One noticed also 
between <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1543</b> and<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1549</b>, several sales in Dorchester involving Robert <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Martyn</b>
of Alfpuddle, Esq - a known friend of both the Bartletts and the Churchills. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> On the 20 Oct <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

John Stratford, all three lately belonging to the Priory of St John, Dorchester, recently dissolved, and lately in the occupation of one Fabian Cornwyke, was now to be
sold to an Owen Hayman, he to hold same of
the King in free Burage, of his Borough
of Dorchester'- as detailed by Charter.  [As noted earlier, I believe this was typical
of Dorchester properties whereby one
effectively held one's property oby Leasehold only; and so the holder would be addressed as being 'of Dorchester, Gent' 
(not 'Esq)'. [Any further entries found involving Churchills or Bartletts in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540-50</b>s
can be placed here. The purchase of the ex-Chantry property by John Churchill,
also in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1549</b>, I believe, was
oddly not noted at this point.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> We may recall our reference earlier
to the surprising report that <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">a John
Churchill</b> had been a Bailiff in Dorchester as early as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1525 </b>- implying his  possible birth  around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1500</b>, or earlier. As we have
since noted several entries for
?subsequent John Churchill(s)    in the
roles of Witness, Constable and Bailiff (as just above), one would reasonably assume thhey were likely all the same man - continuing to about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b>. or even <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1549</b> - and still be in keeping with a
birth around<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1500. </b> This
could thus include the John Churchill, Clothier (and/or Draper) of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1549</b> and. even more, he who
Witnessed the first sale  noted    of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538/39.</b> The progenitor of the later Churchills of
Dorchester we have taken however to be the John Churchill who married Edith Bond in ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b> and had as their first born
William in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541, </b>and then Elizabeth (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">!543</b>) , and finally John Jnr in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545 </b>(he later 'of Corton, Gent')
- all their subsequent marriages being consistent with such years of birth (not
earlier) as would be that of their father John 1  born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1518</b>
- with a marriage of ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538-40</b>,
respectively - rather than so significantly
earlier (as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500-10</b> and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1525-30</b>, say). In any case, the seeming later John (Edith's husnand)  died quite young  in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1557</b>
aged on the latter  basis, about 38-39.
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">   [</b>A first marriage  by ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">
1540 </b> would <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  With this new scenario, we must of course ask
' who was this earlier John Churchill's father ? And we recall that the Colliton pedigree for
the Dorchester Churchills provides no clues - as though the one who first
drafted it wasn't sure either.  We had
understood that the William Churchill
who had emigrated from Devon to Dorset around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1515-20 </b> or so was the father
not only of Roger Churchill, who married Jane Peverell about<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1540</b>, but of his apparently slightly
younger brother John (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1517-18, </b>say)
- who married around this same
time. Moreover, we must continue to point
out that this latter John named his first born <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">William</b>. We shall leave this
for now (basically 'in the air') and continue examining any other, earlier Dorchester
records   in case they may yet reveal some suggested answers to this matter.<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> As noted, we found nothing before
that <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538/39</b> entry for John Churchill (as a Witness) until a reference was noted (when examining earlier years) concerning that  position of Bailiff for a man of this same
name   for <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1525</b>. But we now find
something interesting for <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1521</b>, just four years before, when a Charter was enrolled into the Dorchester records which stated
that Joan Aden (nee Churchill), late wife of Robert
Aden, thereby granted to her
son John Aden her house on the east side of South Street<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> - </b>which was next to that of John
Williams.  It stated also that she had received this house as a
bequest from her brother <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Thomas
Churchill - </b>to hold of the Lords of the Fee of the Borough of Dorchester'. Two Attorneys were appointed, as directed by the Charter, to
ensure the legality of this transfer of
the Lease. It was witnessed by two
Bailiiffs and 12 others   on 21 May, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1521</b>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Now, if we assume that said Joan,
then a widow with a grown son John, was then reasonably aged about 45-50, say,
and her already deceased brother Thomas Churchill had left her the house as a
bequest, and so possibly a little older
than she, both could quite reasonably have been born in the period
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1465-1475</b>. (We may recall that our William Churchill of
Rockbeare was the younger brother of a <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Thomas</i>
Churchill   thought to have been born about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1475-'85</b>. 'Thomas' was not a
common forename amongst the Churchills considered thus far.) However, that Devon Thomas seems
to have left a Will dated <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1577 (</b>yet
to be read<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">) - <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> </i></b><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">unless</i>
it was that of a son of  this said Thomas (Snr) - who had possibly followed
his uncle (William) eastwards to the Dorchester area ?  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> In any case, we find next, in going
back to earlier dates,  another Charter, dated the 11<sup>th</sup>
year of the reign of Edward the IV (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1470</b>) which recites details of a sale of a house on
the south side of high West Street which
was held previously by the Feeoffment of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill</b>, a brother of
one <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Osyth Churchill</b>.  We
might reasonably place the birth of such brothers around the period <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1420-30</b>, say, and (most) likely within
the same family as discussed above. An
uncommon forename such as Osyth could
prove useful in seeking out earlier relatiobships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> In any case, this brings us within
reach of our next find - being a portion of the Will of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">one John Chirchille</b>, dated 28 Oct <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1418,</b> which was read out in the Dorchester Court on
the 4<sup>th</sup> March <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1420</b> (7 Henry V) - probably shortly after this
John had died (and so became enrolled in the official,
records with Witnesses, etc).         In it, John says -I, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Chirchille of <u>Waddone</u>,</b>
Dorset bequeathe to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Chirchulle</b>, my <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">younger</i> son and his heirs, after the
death of Margery, my wife, a Burgage with Curtilage adjacent (House and
Garden), in West Street, Dorchester, (between those of Richard Turke and John
Chalpin (?Chafin)). Again, we may
estimate  that said John, the testator, would likely be born around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1360</b>,
say, and so married Margery by about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1390</b>,
and had their children around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1400</b> or so. If he named his younger son after himself,
this might imply he named his elder son
(born, say, ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1395</b>) after his own
differently-named father - which name at present remains unknown to us It might also have been John, of course.  He would likely inherit Waddon, one suspects
and would in turn be expected to live to
about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1470</b>, say. Would the Churchills of Devon know of this
branch of the family in south-east Dorset - quite possibly residing also in
Dorchester from  the mid-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1400</b>s ?? Did William of Rockbeare (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1490</b>) make contact with same   as he
moved eastwards ? Were the Bartelot or
Martyn families a common denominator ? [Or, the Wadhams ?]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Proceeding (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">E 179/ 363/ 275</b>) concerning that possibly later John
Churchill   of Waddone (Waddon),
Dorset   which records Receipts issued for payments made pertaining to the Tythe tax (of one tenth of
some assessed property values) collected
for the churches in Salisbury diocese 
by one <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Circholl</b> (as so spelt in this Proceeding) for a local Abbot in one case   and then sent to Canterbury - dated
ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1463
- 1465</b>. In it, we
see that this John was described as the 'Bailiff for the Abbot of Netley'. We may quote the National Archives website

to gain some idea of the matter: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

(likely born about<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1360</b>, say, wrote
his Will in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1418</b> and part of it was
published in the Dorchester Municipality Records and read on March 1st <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1420</b> before Witnesses (shortly after his death that year). The
family clearly retained their possession of Waddon (next to Corton) through the
mid-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1400</b>s (with the War of the Roses
resulting in some turmoil of  royal loyalties - including some Abbeys and
Priories, no doubt). And these would
become the centre of attention again after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535</b>
-when Henry VIII began to dissolved the Monasteries such that they (and their many associated
properties) were sold off to  the highest bidders (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b>s)  - by the Commissioners and their Agents
appointed to do so (and possibly re-sold if they were initially
unjustified 'bargains' - at a profit). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that amalgam of inter-married families -
as the Bartletts, the Martyns, the Churchills and, later,  the Tregonwells, etc, What were the roles of the otherwise
Devonshire Wadhams and Courteneys - both before and  after that period   ie ca `<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500-1550</b> ? Did they provide a link or bridge between
such as Colyton in south-east Devon
(with its Castle) and Portisham, in south-east  Dorset - at Waddon and Corton (next to Corfe Castle)  possibly via Catherston, Bradford or
Dorchester ? Those two powerful families
seemed to have properties in both regions. From whence might the Churchills have come - to Waddon  et al ? Had they (as  formerly 'de
Courcelles')   held it from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1066,</b> or
even before ? Or, had they a temporary centre in nearby Hampshire (where

Also, I have various other Municipal record
items to include somewhere appropriate. Thus, there are a number of documents on Waddon manor (Dorset) held in
the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre under their File Code 865 / xxx. These include two grants of property in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

are also two Sets of property Deeds for
Waddon mentioning various family names (over the years) including Churchill - but rather later (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1561-1707</b>)  in 865/111 and 865/96. There are,
in the latter, names of several Witnessses to a marriage (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1594 -98</b>) between a Reymes and Coker (re a Farm in Portisham) that include the names Trenchard, Gould, Samways, Meller, Napper, Chapple, and Garland

description of lands in various Manors, including some in Waddon -
held by Notley Abbey ca  2
Rich III  (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

references to Southampton (where there
was a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Netley</b> in ancient times and, as noted,  a manor called Churchill, I believe). A Notley Abbey (and/or Priory) seems  to also have been in Buckinghamshire - with
widely distributed church properties for income. The Bailiff  role may have been in respect of <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

visit to the National Archives at nearby Kew, made during that same trip south   still seeking information concerning  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William
Churchill Snr (ca 1490-1570+)</b> , but without very much benefit either,  the 16<sup>th</sup> century writing being  often indecipherable.   I was however,
reminded at some point that I should
finally look up what I could find about the oddly named ''<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Robert Bartlett, alias Hancock'</b> which I had come across earlier on a number
of  occasions  as one who seemed to be somehow associated
(ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540-50</b>) with Piddleton, Dorset in general and even with Muston manor at
times.! I had clearly left it on the
periphery of my attention for too long. This has now been corrected and led to the following resume. We shall therefore consider this next before
returning to our primary coverage of the Dorset Churchills per se  (rom page 72) which may now benefit from any
new interpretations facilitated by the insertion here of this  20+ page  section on this most relevant family: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> The following is a resume of what I
discovered - to my joy and amazement -
about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">the Bartlett family.</b> But, before gaining any insight as to the
specific name '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Robert Bartlett, alias
Hancock'</b> which had caught my eye, I'd noticed a later  Chancery case
- <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">C8/112/52</b> - <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Bartlett v Browne and Churchill</b>
at the National Archives . It was for
some reason signed by one Hugh Wadham and concerned property in  Lutton,
Dorset - being the same parish from where our first Dorchester John Churchill (1's)
 wife Edith Bond, the daughter of one
Richard Bond, had come - whose family appeared to be of long standing there. Both the Bonds and Wadhams, as I believed, had some connections with the Churchills and it now seemed that all three families had some mutual
interactions, as well, with the
Bartletts. However, the Bartletts concerned did not, on first examination, appear to represent a branch of that family that would advance our understanding of the origins of our Churchill family,
although  there <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">may</i> have been some clues there   so we examined  this first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Thus, two bothers - Thomas and
Richard Bartlett, both of Lutton, Dorset  'Husbandmen' (with wives, Mary and Joan)  complained that their father Andrew Bartlett
, late of Lutton , deceased, \had been seized of one Copyhold Tenement in the manor of Lutton
(as recorded by Copy Roll)  for the
term of their lives   with the Reversion
thereof to go to their brother Andrew
Barrett Jnr, but Andrew Snr had also held the 'Remainder' (of
the Tenement seemingly) and he had made
a contract and agreement with one Thomas Corbett (?), also of Lutton [at which point the text becomes too
difficult to decipher reliably] So, I
had it photo-copied at Kew and sent to me on-line   to scrutinise
more carefully at home. Sadly, this was
little better. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> The disagreement seemed to involve the renting out of property
and certain guarantees for other Bartlett children (Robert , Susan and Mary) to whom a John Churchill of
Lutton, Yeoman paid &pound;100 (a lot
then) and a certain Cottage with 4 acres was to go to a Henry Browne   who was to marry a Bartlett
daughter (I believe). Figures of
&pound;60 and &pound;260 were also mentioned. Unfortunately, there appeared to be no dates
shown (other than some time after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553</b>
possibly), so one couldn't relate the
timing and the individuals involved in these event in Lutton to other events or earlier
individuals of interest elsewhere. But,
it later appeared that any earlier connections between the families concerned
was more often at a higher level of social status than that of Husbandman and Yeoman. But the Esquires and Gentry would all have their share of those who soon descended to all
levels of society below those of that status   with some later reversing this direction of movement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">            We may thus try to discover anything useful with regard to any interactions
between such as the Bartletts and Churchills in areas nearer Muston or Pulston, say -
hopefully above the level of Husbandman and Copyholder, as noted at Lutton If Subsidy taxes were paid by the Bartletts
there, did any Churchills not at least
engender records of their own presence there or nearby also - in the<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1530s or '40s </b>? Are there no extant records of
same remaining (as any Muster lists)   unless one was an undoubted Leaseholder or Freeholder ? Manor records clearly show the names of Copyholders at neighbouring (Eton-owned) Piddlehinton Manor (eg   one Thomas Lowman); what might the comparable records of Muston or Pulston Manor Freeholders
(as local Abbeys or even the Bartletts) show   in regard to any  presumed Copyholder (or Leaseholder) renting from them   over that slightly  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">earlier</i>
period ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  And, after they sold it, rather later, to
the other  branch of the Churchills (those of Dorchester), who became or
remained the Copy or
Lease-holder) of such Manor lands ? We
can but travel hopefully - guided in part by an analysis of the Bartletts' comparable
 journey. They stress their connections with three
families in particular - including the Churchills. Surely their many records
witness the name of those who held the Copyholds of Pulston and/or Muston (from
ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1530 </b>to<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1580</b>), say,  ie <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>before</u></i>
they sold the latter at least, over
the period <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1586</b> to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1612, </b> to the new Freeholder - being now a Churchill
of the Dorchester family<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">   </b>if oddly rather
gradually and piecemeal ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Our focus was ultimately to be on
this Bartlett family's involvement in the Piddleton (Piddletown) area of Dorset, and in particular initially with Muston Manor
of neighbouring Piddlehinton  parish, in the period <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535-45</b>, say.  Eventually,
the Bartlett's seem to have sold  their Freehold in that small manor - by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1612   </b>to a member of the Dorchester branch of  the Churchill family - both branches having descended - seemingly   from
a Churchill family of Devon who were of landed (Freeholder) status in the
recent past.  The  possibly senior  branch appear to have been  seated over the same period at <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Bradford Peverell</b> (initially). Both branches  emanated, we believe,  from <u>the same one father</u>   <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William

at either Pulston or Muston by mid-century - ie from ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Dorset). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

resulting from the fulsome investigations of the Bartlett family by their Australian
progeny (especially by one <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Peter
Bartlett </b>apparently) provides
promising potential in resolving our own
uncertainties, we appreciate that it may
 well  remain unresolved (for a variety of reasons)
and so must continue to temper any
optimism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

details regarding this family's presence
in south Dorset after first describing
briefly their origins and <u>subsequent spread in south England  generally</u> - as gratefully provided by

normal">The first Bartlett</b>, as the
first Churchill, appears to have arrived
in England in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1066</b> - with William the
Conqueror. Both families would function
eventually at the highest levels in the new society - with the
Churchills doing so rather later and
less widely than the Bartletts. As
mentioned earlier, the new King William  relied
on about a dozen or so Chief Barons with their large retinues of knights and
supporters - ie as his 'Special Companions' - expected to protect and support
him and his family. One of these with
whom the Bartletts seem closely aligned was that of Robert de  l' Eu, a powerful Baron related to William
himself. Another close ally was the
family of 'de Brionne'  seemingly from the same Normandy district as
the Bartletts.         The French forms of
many of these surnames were
gradually adapted to more English
versions. Thus, de Brionne became de Bryan, and then Brian, de
Courcelle became Churchelle, and
thence Churchill and the name that became Bartlett was apparently
originally 'de Bartelot' (pronounced, I assume,  Bar - tel   owe). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:
115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         </span></b><span style="font_size:
12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> The de Brionnes had an important role in the protection of William's royal
family (and his immediate successors),
while the Bartelots apparently had a similar role, as 'Special
Companions', in turn, in the protection of the de Brionnes/Bryans - both
coming from the Liseux area in Normandy. Thus, where the Bryans settled on
widely distributed lands granted them by the King, so too were the Bartelots/Bartletts   on
lands they obtained comparably through the good offices of the Bryans living nearby. Any other families sharing in this 'Companionship' in particular areas (as the west country
generally), including the Churchills, would likely have done so by less obvious, less direct means (such as inter-marriage) which
we do not try to analyse in detail here   in those pre-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1500s</b> days. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         [The origin of the name Bartelot is suggested to go back as far as the time of
Chrarlemagne's mother Queen Bertha   one
of whose daughters, also named Bertha, married a Duke and they called an early
son 'Berthelot'   apparently meaning
'little Bertha'. He in turn named a son
'someone'de Berthelot' (born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1010</b>), say, who apparently had a son <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Adam de Barthelot</b> around<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1035. </b>This<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>man, who accompanied
William in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1066</b>,  was considered the ancestor of all the later Bartletts in England - whatever the
precise origin of his family's earlier name.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> This first Bartelot in
England, Adam de Bartelot (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1035-1077</b>), soon returned to  Liseux
however, to marry a French girl with whom he had two sons   Robert and Ralph de Bartelot   seemingly in the late <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1060</b>s. (Marrying an English
girl instead could compromise Norman
property inheritance rights). In their protection roles, the Brionne's and the Bartelots were soon granted
various manors and, in the case of the Brionne's, eventually raised to
Baron status themselves.  But they
eventually failed in the direct male line and that Brionne/Bryan/Brian  name gradually disappears from the  property records   by the late<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1300s/early 1400s</b>. But the Bartelot/Bartlett family itself seemingly thrived in male progeny
 and it became apparent that they
continued to reside in many of those same places - in Sussex, Dorset, Devon and Somerset   where the Bryans had originally held  Freehold
manors   in the 12<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup>
centuries (including 'Brianspiddle' in
Dorset, for example, near Piddletown/Piddleton where a latter Bartlett
certainly resided). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> The Churchills  had also been granted certain properties in
these same counties apparently, but they too suffered increasingly from having
too few viable sons to inherit same - although it seems they managed to 'hang on' (just). The marriage of their many more daughters soon diluted the extent of their
earlier manorial holdings(portions of which would have to accompany their daughters to promote
marriages).         Some of the few remaining
younger sons were necessarily reduced to the role of Yeomen as noted - renting
or managing rather than owning property - as Copyholders. But, through the Bartletts, this was
apparently to change - especially from about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1535-45</b>   through the unexpected activities of one '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John
Bartelot /Bartlett alias Hancocke'</b>. He had been  appointed an Agent by
Cromwell or his Deputy   for overseeing t sales after the Dissolution of the Mesenteries in the
south-west.   This will hopefully be described more
thoroughly later. In the meantime, we continue describing that  background of Bartletts in the west country more generally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Adam de Bartelot's eldest sons were thus, in their turns, the effective Stewarts to the de Brionne's and assisted them in administering their widely scattered manors. One estate in West Sussex, at Stopham,
however, seems initially to have been held by a Robert d' l'Eu, second son
of Count Robert d' l'Eu shortly after the Conquest   when much land in that invaded area was granted to that
important Count and hence to his sons, in turn, although first son William 'de
l' Eu had unwisely sought to rebel against the Conqueror and was
eventually caught and executed. It thus remained in second son Robert d' l' Eu's
family. Who were they ? It somehow became jointly owned later by the de Bartelots and the de Bryans (sometime after the Doomsday inquiries of<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1085</b>); and when a de Bryan daughter (sole heiress) of same married
a John Bartelot, Esq  around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1200</b>, the latter family then inherited that important Sussex estate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> It seems that it could be argued
that the Stopham estate was essentially the property of the Bartelots from the
beginning however   to the extent that second Robert d' 'l'Eu's
name might reasonably have arisen from
(Ro) <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Ber d' l' ot</b> and soon
shortened to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Bartelot</b>  rather than this
latter name having arisen as mentioned
above (through Bertha's son - Berthelot). In any case, at Doomsday, the entry for Stopham was ambiguous (the
scribes often assuming that future readers (essentially tax collectors) would know to whom a given
Christian name - <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">simply</i> <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">entered on its own</i>   as 'Robert',
say, typically referred locally,  unqualified by any surname; a case can thus be
made that a (Ro) bert [de'l'Eu] or 'Robert' (Bertelot) then held it and leased it back to his younger brother Radolphus (Ralph) (de Bartelot) . Several successive
'Ralph Bartelots de Stopham' then held
it through the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1200</b>s. The Bartelot
and d'l'Eu names were said to often appear later in respect of the same lands
and manors and <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">may</i> therefore have been of that same one family from rather earlier.         <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Thus, Stopham remained a Bartelot/Bartlett manor and effective centre for the original family for many years. About the year <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1360</b>, a Thomas
Bartlett of Stopham married Assuline de
Stopham, whose son John in turn married a Joan de Stopham and a grandson, also
John (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1425-1493</b>), married Olive Arthur about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1465</b>. Their two sons Richard and William Bartlett were said to be
born in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1471</b> and ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1475</b>, respectively. This brings us closer to our more understood
Tudor century of the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b>s   when we
hope increasingly to find more information   with specific dates, places and names that gradually shift
westward - to become associated more specifically with south Dorset - and with
the Churchills, amongst several other interactive families, in that west county.
Interesingly, there were several Churchill entries in the records for east
Dorset from the mid -1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">300</b>s
onward (see Waddon manor record above.) Were any early Bartletts
in the vicinity ? It was quite near to Lutton
where those later Husbandmen of that family were in litigation with a Yeoman Churchill. And was the Churchill manor in Hampshire relevant ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

history, early members of their family
gained in position and power by virtue of their close association not only with the de Bryan family, for whom Adam de
Bartelot and his elder son Robert (and succeeding elder sons), had effectively become Stewards, but also with the Arundels, the chief family in the
Bartelot's original base in Sussex.
Thus, they often represented the nearby
Kentish Cinque Ports as MPs  effectively as a gift from that dominant family   to whom
Adam's younger son, Ralph and his line similarly served as trustees and
accountants over future generations. These associations continued through the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> centuries by means of a
succession of mostly elder sons Robert in the first case and of elder sons Ralph in the latter - who tended to remain more at the
family holdings at or near Stopham in Sussex, or in neighbouring Kent, through
to the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b>s. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Maude, married a Ncholas de Mortaine
(later Martyn) of Waterston Manor in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Piddleton,
Dorset</b>. It would likely be the de Bryan's and Martyn's presence and their contacts in Dorset (from that time - ca
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1380, say</b>) that accounted for that
union and property. And where the Bryans settled, the Martyns and the Bartelots
(of Robert's line) were generally also to be found nearby  by virtue of receiving grants of property from the Bryans and by
inter-marriage with them and comparable allied families.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

given church's 'living' was often in the
gift of the local Lord of the Manor   who held that church's 'advowson' Several such advowsons in Dorset were held by
the inter-married Frampton, de la Lynde, Martyn and Bartlett families during those  pre-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1400</b>
times. Said William<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

almost a century later,  the advowson for
this same church was  then held by a
Margaret Frampton   who gave the living
there to a John Bartlett - in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1431</b>  In

the Bryan family finally failed in the male line,  about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1420</b>
or so, the Bartelots/Bartletts were thus
at least well established in many of those same western areas gained through
that family's earlier generosity - who
had gained themselves through their close connection to the Royal family.  Moreover, the Bartletts had themselves gained several important
positions in London through that Royal
favour, before that Bryan connection ceased.  The Bryan's principle residence by then had become  Werdesford (?Waterston) Castle near Piddleton, Dorset where a btanch of the Bartlett family had
apparently also been settled    from
about<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1450</b>. [See below re the year <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1444.]</b> A  Robert Bartelot was later chosen Mayor of nearby Dorchester in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1448-50. </b>His possible brother<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

progression of that family in Dorset as they advanced from the period when, as
churchmen, they held several such  church livings, to one where they began to
hold more land, and also public office - initially in the important local centre of Dorchester. But first, a very good account is presented that sets the scene   of 'the times' then in Dorset (and
elsewhere in England)   'times' that so affected
many - including both the Bartlett and the Churchill families. We may usefully quote from the former's account (with light
paraphrasing) which covers these matters from somewhat earlier: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> -These (late 14<sup>th</sup> and
early 15<sup>t)</sup> centuries)  were
difficult times in England   which had yet to recover fully from the Plague of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1348-49</b>   when half the population of Dorset was lost ......The country was still embroiled in its never ending (100
years) war with France and discontent
with social conditions and with the
church generally was making itself felt. It was also a bad time for the Bartletts - to have lost the
patronage of the now deceased Bryans 
enjoyed for so long. Their own status
gradually changed and would affect future generations as well. Like most Dorset families, they (and the Bryans) had been decimated by the plague - with their numbers
much reduced by the start of the 15<sup>th</sup> century. All the known Bryan estates had been sold or
inherited by other families   except for Stockwood Manor (between Sherborne and
Dorchester) just above Dorchester) and  where, as late as<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1423, </b> its Manor Court
records show that a Phillipa de Bryan, unmarried daughter of the last Sir Guy
de Bryan, still resided there - along with her longest serving ?Steward - Sir William (Bartelot) possibly as a Lessee
of the estate). This status was still
the case in the Manor Court records there in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1444 </b>. Over the
ensuing years, one or more Richard Bartletts held positions locally as Vicars   in two of the many Winterborne
parishes - in south-east Dorset (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1455-95),

would be about this time (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1476</b>)
that Sir Robert de Bartelot was
entrusted by Edward IV to bestowe the Order of the Garter upon a
foreign Duke   of Urbino - an Italian
nobleman then acknowledged as the
'Renaissance Man' par excellence of all Europe. There must have been de
Bartelots then in Royal service of the first Tudor   Henry VII   in London by then. They would
have to have been loyal to a succession of
differing royal families through  those
unstable years of the Wars of the Roses  (on

Dorset, and Somerset   from the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1340s </b>to<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">
1540s+</b>. As explained, they did so initially due to their close association
with two particular families - the Bryans and the Arundels, with later connections with the Martyns, de la Lyndes and Kellaways. During those 200+ years, there would of
course be an impressive 10 or so
generations - of marriages, births and a consequent redistributions of granted,
purchased or inherited properties   in
many such districts. This would no
doubt entail various Robert, John, Richard, William
and Thomas Bartletts - respectively marrying on many occasions into a plethora of other <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">similarly landed</i>
families (including the Martyns and Churchills)   so acquiring yet further
property and local and national positions of public office and influence. Clearly, we make no attempt to analyse  and distil all this potential detail   from
either the Bartlett history itself nor from examining countless other archive sources so arising - including many
property transfer or litigation documents generally over the entire  area. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the early Churchills   in such as Piddleton, Piddlehinton and associated manors. as well as

Moreover, we see that her father William Peverell (d ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1520</b>) was once described as 'of Bardalphston' - being a manor in Piddleton -
as well as 'of Bradford Peverell'. What
could that imply with regard to William Churchill arranging marriage between
his eldest son Roger and said Jane Peverell - <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535-40</b> - then a sole heiress

the seemingly relevant fact that from the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Copyholders of property in or near
Piddleton - apparently owned by the Bartletts. In addition, a Robert Bartlett of
the day either leased himself or owned a former Holles property nearby. This family, who produced a famous MP for
Dorchester, were apparently also related
to two or three of these other relations. We did note that the rent paid for
farms then owned by Eton College   <u>in
nearby Piddlehinton  manor</u> (but <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">not</b>
including Muston manor itself, albeit located in that same parish)   was

also paid rents for same there  although one's initial understanding was that they were in fact  paid (for a time), by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William

? The names of the Muston Lessee or
Copyholder through the period <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1530 to

precise relationships amongst the Bartelots at this time is difficult to determine,

areas of Dorset about then with whom the Bartletts also interacted - the Prowts/Prouts, the Frekes and
the Churchills - and information on them should help clarify relationships,
places and dates for all four
families. The Bartletts had known the Prout family -for a very long time and (were) linked to them by a series of marriages-,
notes the history. They too were of Norman descent and were major landowners 
at Litton Cheney, Frampton and Bridport    (south-west of
Dorchester). They had been Mayors and
Bailiffs of Bridport and a William Prout had been a Dorset MP in Parliament. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Hutchins, in his famous 'History of Dorset', shows an estate near Litton Cheney to be occupied by the Bartelots   initially <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">as Lessees</i>   of absentee
owners (who'd likely purchased it from
the Prouts) then residing in
Hampshire. It was headed then or a
little later by one George Bartelot who
apparently purchased the estate outright
around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500,</b> and it was later in the
hands of his son John Bartlett, before <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1525</b>
when his name appears as a payer of a
Subsidy tax (of &pound;25) there. His son in
turn, another John, was also shown paying tax there a little later (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1539</b> at &pound;35), as well as
appearing on the local Muster list for<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1542</b> 'being 'mounted on horse and armed'. In <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b>, this younger John paid the &pound;25 Subsidy there - with the estate apparently remaining in the family into the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1600</b>s. We assume that the
Prout family had continued in the area as well, beyond the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1540s, </b> as a Prout daughter would marry a Bartlett son
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">in Piddleton</b> about then (see
below). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> The second close family, the
Frekes, were also considerable landowners and held influential positions in the
legal profession and in local government. They too were linked by marriage to all three of the families concerned. Thus, a Joan Prout, who had married a Thomas
Freke, (in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b>), was related
to the Alice Prout who would marry Robert Bartlett at Piddleton in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542</b>. The Freke name will come up again later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> The third family long associated
with the Bartletts were the Churchills
who, according to the Bartlett history, had also arrived in England in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1066</b>   with the name 'de Courcelle' - as part of a contingent led by Robert
de Mortaine (later Martyn) and Count Guido de Brionne (later Bryan). As we have noted, the latter two were both in a position to grant lands to
their closest followers   in those same parts of Wessex (ie Somerset, Devon and
Dorset) where the Bartelots enjoyed similar advantages. All four family names thus appeared close to,
one another in those earliest years (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1300s-1400s</b>). By the mid-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1400</b>s, the Churchill name
had appeared in Dorchester as well as in Court circles in London. (We
have described above their earlier
presence as well in Somerset and Devon
ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1140 -1500+.)</b> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> There were also Bartelots living in
or near Dorchester around these dates, and in adjoining Fordington and Stinsford. A Robert Bartlett had been Mayor in
Dorchester in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1450-53</b> as note above and
his apparent son John was Bailiff there as also mentioned.  Shortly after, they likely resided in one or
other of those latter nearby manors - where the Bartletts would still be associated well into the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1600</b>s. If we assume that
Robert would have been born by about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1415,</b>
and married ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1440</b>, his son John would likely be born shortly
after (by ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1445, say</b>) and reasonably be a Bailiff around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1470.</b> It is this John's son <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William Bartlett</b> - born about then, and
so married by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1495</b>, say, that provides us with our first reliable
evidence regarding relevant dates and connections as the<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1500s</b> loom. For the earliest surviving Piddleton parish church registrations (of baptisms, marriages and burials). commenced in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1538</b>.         From these,
combined with existing names and dates given on Subsidy rolls and Muster Lists,
we can more confidently construct a
network of family relationships   including places and dates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Thus we find that the foregoing <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William</b> is named as father in an
early burial entry in that register of
an adult son <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Edmund Bartlett </b>- dated the 1<sup>st</sup> of January <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b>   at St Mary's church in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> Piddleton</b>a few miles north-east of Fordington. The Bartlett history concluded that as this
latter Bartlett in the family had no property in his name (for which he would
otherwise be recorded as paying Subsidy tax before <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1540</b>), he was likely William's youngest son (of the five it was later concluded he had), the other four being John, Richard, Robert and Thomas. If Edmond was an
adult in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540,</b> aged about 25 and so and
born around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1515</b> (after those four earlier sons (and possibly 2
or 3 daughters)   all born at roughly
2 year intervals, we could reasonably
place William's marriage to about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1492 </b>or
so (when he apparently married an Alice
or Aline Covert). This indicated his birth around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1470,</b> as
suggested above   long before those church registers had actually commenced. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> William and Alice/Aline) would thus
have their large family between about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1493
</b> and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1518</b>, say, in whatever
order. He subsequently paid &pound;30 tax for
his Piddleton property in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1525</b> - by
which time his sons would be aged ca 10 to 30. William was believed to have also inherited and held property at both Fordington (on the edge of
Dorchester) and at Sock Dennis, just over the border into  Somerset, on both of which he also paid tax. That in Fordington was later
inherited by his son Robert (born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1506,
</b>say) on William's death by
about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1542 </b> (as William was
apparently still alive in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540 </b>   attending  youmgest son Edmond's early burial that
year). A possible older son Richard (born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1502</b>) was said
to have inherited the family's partial
hold on Sock Dennis by that time. The
other, possibly eldest, son <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John
Bartlett</b> (born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1497</b>, say),
would later also hold property in Somerset; but <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>his</u> </i>prior career was most interesting, if rather complex, and is detailed more fully below. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> First, in this regard, we seek to
explain a certain seeming anomaly and confusion in the findings in the Subsidy and Muster rolls over this period. A little to the north-east of Dorchester, in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> Piddleton</b>, the Subsidy list for <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1525</b> showed this  John
Bartlett (born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1497)</b> and thus not the one of Litton Cheney)   paying just &pound;2, and his
apparent brother Richard (born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1502</b>),
just &pound;3. But a William Bartlett,
seemingly their father (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1470</b>), paid &pound;30 there that year (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1525</b>) , indicating he held most of a
good property in Piddleton. 20 years later (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1545</b>), we find eldest son John, now aged about 47, paying that
higher rate (&pound;35)  having
presumably inherited the bulk of the
Piddleton property on his father's death around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542</b>. John had apparently married an Agnes Hancock
around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1520</b>   with whom he would have 4
sons himself  Richard (?<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

not yet holding sufficient property to pay more. We have assumed that  these 4 sons were born between  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1520 </b>and<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1530</b>, say, and so aged then from about 10 to 20 ; ie  essentially teenagers - not required to pay

Muster findings of just 3 years earlier
(<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542</b>) which show that John, who
would then be about 45, was 'mounted and with arms' awhile his 4 young sons
were seemingly also available,   but only 'on foot'. All of these male Bartletts, including John, were however now described with just their
mother's  surname 'Hancock' in that Muster list. John died in<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1558</b>, referring in his Will to his
wife Agnes and their son Robert (who would then be about 30), and to another Robert Bartlett 'the younger' - possibly a grandson), but to
no other brothers, sons, or
daughters). By <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

another generation on, an even later John Bartlett alone pays
the Subsidy there - at just &pound;3; this
small amount implying that someone else
likely then owned or held the major
property there (or this John was still
too young to pay more). [Note: We wrote the forgoing before the following -

which John's (and thus the generation
each set represented   never mind which were accorded the names 'Hancock' and which 'Bartlett' on the next Muster and Subsidy lists), needs to be better
determined. We may recall  that in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1518-22 </b> William's eldest son
John Bartlett married Agnes <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Hancock</i> and, because of the primogeniture law then still applying,
it would increase the scope of their descendants' inheritance (ie by including any from the female Hancock side of
the family) if John and his descendants added the name Hancock to ,their
own Bartlett surnames The names in that
form (or just as Hancock on its own) on those Muster lists were thus those for John and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">his</i></b> four (Hancock') sons, not any of those of his father
William. But the former's surnames (of John and sons) seem to have reverted to Bartlett by the time of the next Subsidy just 3 years later
in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b>. <u>There seems to have been an advantage in
utilising this alternative tewporary surname when ex-Chancery properties were
being bought and/or sold , or re-sold, at suspiciously low prices</u>. The
reason for such sales will be elaborated below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Caundle.(5 miles east of Sherborne). But, by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1569</b>, payments were
made only at Litton and Piddleton - the
latter (only &pound;3) by a presumably younger generation John Bartlett. [What about Muston, Pulston,  Fordington or Stinsford?]         As mentioned, the introduction of parish
registers in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538</b> could well provide more reliable information
concerning births, marriages and deaths
in our families of interest - if and where they'd survived. This would apply to those in all 6 of the
above areas where the Bartletts still held property, and so generally resided,
when those significant life events would be registered. We shall
focus next on Piddleton in particular in this respect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Piddleton church marriage register (gratefully transcribed decades ago by
Phillimore and now posted on-line by that parish's presentday records
manager; (those for baptisms and burials sadly not being yet available), was that for a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1516</b> - possibly as a later born son
of William and Alice, or one of their eldest son John's earlier born sons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Fordington, Robert in Somerset and Thomas still in
Piddleton, above. What of John's own story during or after his
residence in Piddleton   where his
four Bartlett-Hancock sons were
apparently born, grew up and married - ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1520-1540s
</b>? If their respective uncles had
married and disbursed to other areas, where did John's sons, also now married, go ? And what did their parents John and Agnes do ? Who, if any of
them, remained at Piddleton ? Possibly
just Robert. None of the family lived
at Piddlehinton's own Manor, nor at its neghbouring Muston Manor Hall or Farm   which the family
had bought in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b> from -?whom-(?Cerne Abbey)- .which they
then rented out to either Leaseholders or Copyholders (as
the earlier Churchills possibly or,

one <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Nathaniel

while a William Jnr (?bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1524</b>), having likely married elsewhere nearby around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b>, say, had a daughter Johane baptised at Piddleton (where they likely lived)   on 6 March<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">

Bartlett/Bartelot/Hancock, seemingly eldest son of that earlier William Bartelot. John was said to have eventually retired to his main home   in Piddleton   where </span>he
died in late <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1558</b>, <span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">aged
about 65  or so apparently.  In his Will, (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">PROB 11/42/A/440</b>), written on 4 Nov <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1558</b>, he does  not
sound like a man through whose auspices
so much valuable property was apparently 'transferred', about 15 years
earlier. After leaving various friends
some single Pecks of wheat and/or barley and the Piddletown church 20 shillings, he refers to
just one son - Robert (both having been for a time 'alias Hancocke')   to whom
he leaves various livestock and 'all my Wooden
houses, and also 6 -..?.....'. Robert is also to receive a relatively small amount of cash (&pound;25 ?) ' to be paid him directly by the hand of my
wife Agnes' (who at least <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">is</i> later
also referred to by him as 'Robert's
mother'). But Robert is required to pay any of his father John's
outstanding debts. He leaves his house
in Dorchester to a Roger Bartlett
(no relationship stated)  and to 'Robert Bartlett the younger', he
leaves a yearling bullock. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> He then Wills that 'Agnes my wife shall hold all 'my Copyholds' peacefully -
without any trouble from my son Robert'. And to Agnes he also leaves 'all my movable and unmovable goods'. [One is curious as to what 'my Copyholds' refers here; one would assume, almost by
definition, that it wouldn't refer to 'my Freeholds' and/or Leaseholds (which one would normally 'let
out' to Copyholders) . Did they produce an income stream for their inheritor ?]         He then appoints his son Robert to be Executor of his Will but adds that Sir Thomas
Garland is to have his 'Meat and Drink
provided him by Robert'   for Sir Thomas' life, as well as both Robert and Agnes each paying him &pound;10 yearly (!) -
she 'during her widowed estate' (state ?). Why this consideration of a knighted Thomas Garland ?  Did he assist John in the earlier years ? (See
wife named ?Carland above.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Butt, Roger Riche, John Jollyett and John Bonde   who were to receive two sheep each (ie 8 in total   4 from Robert
and 4 from Agnes, so divided). - 'for their pains'. The Will was proved on March 1<sup>st</sup>,
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1558/59 </b> by the son Robert Bartlett. as Executor.         Robert would likely be about 40 then and so the eventual sale of Muston by one
Nathaniel Bartlett after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1600</b> would quite possibly  be a
grandson of this Robert, born about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1570</b>,
say, to a son of said Robert   of almost any forename - born about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540-50</b>; there were several born in Piddleton then, I believe. He would presumably be the eldest surviving
son of a Bartlett of this same status. We find no Will later listed for either
John's widow Agnes or his son Robert   although there is an
intriguing entry in the Archives for an Inquisition Post Mortem on 'Robert
Bartlett alias Hancock' dated Nov <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1577-78</b>         <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">(C

Emma in which reference is made to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">the

 for whom the Complainants were or had
been Executors. The brief resume notes that it concerned a possible Fraud in
regard to a Contract pertaining to Muston Farm, Piddlehinton  and a House in Puddletown called Islington House
which is or was owned by Robert Bartlett. (he possibly said Alice's deceased
husband,  [See above such reference, or
his  son]. It was dated somewhere between <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1588</b> and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

starting out in life as married adults would of course be very
interested in the availability of any reasonable 'first homes' for their
expected families. This was certainly
the case for young John Churchill in Dorchester where, without any significant
funds we know of, he suddenly acquired a
very good ex-Chantry property ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b>). One might find that these recently
married sons of John Bartlett similarly
appear, otherwise unexpectedly, in
different towns and villages in south
Dorset which had recently been the property of various religious foundations. It
appears that some of the other contemporary Churchills also so benefitted - as
at Little Bredy, Compton,  Frampton and Pulston. <br style="mso_special_character:line_break">

which we learn that  --John Bartelot was appointed to the position of 'Investigator of Monasteries'.- .But how
would such an appointment have come
about, for a small Freeholder living in Piddleton in rural Dorset ? It would have resulted, says the history (somewhat vaguely), through -<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">influence exerted by other
members of the Bartelot family</i>- - that is, by those of William's
generation, or before (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1520s-40s</b>), partly back in Sussex but, one feels,   mainly  in London. This appointment must have transpired by about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1536-38</b>, when John would have been
coming up 40 - with his children 'back
home about to marry in Piddleton, or nearby  and settle down   wherever. Just where that 'wherever' might be for them (and their friends and relatives) could soon  be influenced  from a much greater choice throughout Dorset 
 <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">than
would otherwise have been the case</b>   previously  as we shall see. After becoming an Agent or Commissioner, John
Bartlett  was becoming a 'good man to
know, or be related to'especially for that next aspiring generation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> It seems that some years
before, the King's chief minister Thomas
Cromwell had taken an interest in a legal wrangle in which  land had been taken from the Bartelots in Sussex. He became aware of the latter family's apparent bona fides, trustworthiness
and general competence and subsequently
assisted those of that family who had settled in the west country   where he was himself once an MP   for Taunton -  in gaining various appointments at Court - from
ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1530</b> or so. Thus, John's brother Richard Bartelot, became one of Cromwell's Secretaries. Henry
would soon dissolve the Monasteries (and all related religious
institutions) and, by about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535,</b>
they were starting to be sold off in considerable numbers, generally to the highest local bidder (and soon
re-sold)    with money pouring into the
country's (and Henry's) Treasury, and likely
into the profits of  local Agents.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> There was thus considerable  scope for fraud and improper valuations in such a massive sell off. When the King asked Cromwell to organise some oversite, he seems
to have chosen <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Sir John Tregonwell</b>
to be the Chief Inspector in the south-west in this respect. Sir John was a very bright man out of
Cornwall who thrived at Oxford in Civil Law. He was soon holding important government positions in London and amongst
other activities,  had guided the King in
his recent divorce proceedings against Catherine of Aragon. Sir John  later  settled
in south  Dorset himself around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1534</b>   on marrying  the widow
of  one of the landed <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Martyn family</b> of that county and thus soon knew most of the local
land owners nearby. His marriage ensured that he was then related to a number
of such inter-married local Dorset families   as the  Bartletts, the Churchills, the Kellaways and
the Martyns   all of whom owned or would soon own property in and near
Piddleton (and of course elsewhere  across south Dorset). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> One of these was John Bartelot/Bartlett
of same whom he appointed to be one of
his Investigators and later a Commisioner (to first value all local church and
Abbey property and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">their many associated manors. mills and advowsons (church livings</i>)</b>
pertaining thereto.         Those in these
inter-related families who hadn't inherited the first (eldest) son's major
share of the families' existing small estates, through primogeniture, would suddenly now be <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">very</i> interested in any new
properties that might now become available t in this new situation  ie    for 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> sons,
especially !  Monasteries and Abbeys were
of prime interest when they also owned so many properties  (for income) in  more distant parishes much beyond their own
immediate Abbey grounds.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

normal">540</b>s that  John Churchill, a
young Draper in Dorchester, purchased an
ex-Chantry property there - when having
no recorded property-owning father behind him.  He was thence rather suddenly of a propertied
status, himself.  The Bartlett history,
as we have noted, emphasised the long friendship
between themselves and, amongst others, the Churchills. Their
account points out in this regard that
an English professor and authority on the Dissolution period, confirmed that a 'cartel' of well-off Dorset landowners, of which John Tregonwell
and his neighbour <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">John Bartelot/Bartlett ('alias
Hancock'</b>) of Piddleton had been
accused of fraud  in some of these early
transactions. In any case, it was, notes the history, during this time of Henry
VIII that the Bartelot name had already reached
its zenith amongst Court circles in London itself (as noted above)    having
held  useful positions there. [4 such names of same may be entered here.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

involved in the oversite of these property sales (and re-sales) turn out to be
clustered around that south Dorset area, including Piddleton and Dorchester. Examination of <u>the archives for Crown
sales of ex-monastery properties</u>  (in
E 127) reveals an almost endless stream of sales made via Sir John Tregonwell   to the,
Kellawys, Churchills, Martyns, Frekes, Rogers and Bartelots/Bartletts,
including John and brother Richard. We
may quote one line: -Although far too
numerous to be reproduced in this
history, such vast Dorset institutions as Bath Abbey, Milton Abbey, Cerne Abbey
and Hinton Abbey, as well as a multitude
of smaller monastery-owned Manors, Farms and Mills, etc  were acquired by this cartel of Piddleton  area  families''  -  backed as they were by official
Auditors/Valuers who were seemingly
part of thi same  scheme -! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

friends and associates who were able to
acquire such property <u>on very favourable terms-</u>. Hence, John Tregonwell,
by the time he wrote his Will (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1565</b>)
, was no longer simply  'of
Piddleton' but was now 'of Milton' (with prime ex Abbey buildings
and land he had at least paid for   but probably rather less than their true
worth)  as would be his heirs'  for some generations  to come. They noted too that while John Bartelot's surname was generally already accepted as
'Bartlett' by the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1530</b>s , he and his son Robert, nevertheless soon re-adopted 'Bartelot alias Hancocke', etc  in many of these transactions and, apparently, without always disclosing their
true (often changing) main abodes over that period'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

executed (related to other  matrimonial
matters) by Henry - in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b> - many
of the transactions referred to were already in hand and often on-going as
would prove convenient; one of these of

alias Mustertonne, alias Piddle Musterton and its Farm, (mainly) in Piddlehinton  and (with a little in neighbouring)  Piddletown, with pasture for 100 ewes, 4 rams and their lambs, the stock and moiety
of hay on the Farm currently belonging to Cerne Abbey, value &pound;10.10.4; plus lands in Rumford near Worth
(Purbeck), and Eastworth, parcel of Tewkesbury Abbey, lands in Tarrant
Rawson, parcel of Tarrant Abbey; Chapman;s coppice in Milborne St Andrew; the site of the Priory of Hinton  (all the above ) sold to John Bartlett alias Hancock and his son Robert
and their heirs for the sum of
&pound;710.5/.- (This was seemingly the total

still belonging to C<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

that Cerne Abbey was closer to Pulston Manor which was likely also part of that
Abbey's holdings. It is not known (as yet) who may have purchased that Abbey's many other
properties but it seems that Sir John Tregonwell himself obtained permission to
buy the larrger and richer Milton Abbey for  &pound;1000.  for
himself and heirs. Cerne Abbey may have
been disposed in a more piecemeal way - to various smaller purchasers - likely friends and relatives of John
Bartlett - as the Martyns and the Churchills.  This could include property in Pulston,
Frampton, Little Bredy and Compton Valence. [Who held Frampton Court, one
wonders,  before the Brownes, another
influential family but recently Yeomen),  acquired it ?]  Some Dorchester sales transpired as late as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1549</b>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all this property must have been one or more of the larger local Abbeys or
Monasteries recently acquired and then  sold 'by the Crown' following the Dissolution of the Monasteries
Act of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535</b>. Yet, just who so held the Freehold of Muston Manor (and Farm), or that of
Pulston,  themselves, prior to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545,</b> is not explicitly mentioned. We
may however reasonably assume that it had been Cerne Abbey - until some
uncertain date ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540-47</b>, say.  In regard to that latter Abbey, we may note
comments provided in an excellent site
on that institution (cerneabbeyhistory.org)  pertaining to that period: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

AD  as a Benedictine Monastery whose  ruins are located at Cerne Abbas (about 6
miles north of Dorchester and a little north-west of Piddleton) - is near
Forston and Godmanston. (The latter was held
later by the quite wealthy Brownes of nearby
Frampton.) As with its comparable local
Abbeys - of Sherborne, Milton and Abbotsbury, Cerne was worth about &pound;500 annually by the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b>s. It was a significant land owner of about 8,000 acres scattered across
many (28) villages and  towns in several  parishes. These included Long and Little Bredy
, Milburne St Andrew, and many others in
respect of  which Bartletts, Martyns and Churchills in particular seem to have benefitted, and possibly others in the Cerne valley
itself - as in nearby Charminster, with
its Pulston Manor about 2 miles north (near Forston, Frampton and Milburne). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Cerne Abbey had been an ally of the Yorkists before <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1471</b> when Henry VI and wife
Margaret of Anjou once sought protection there, .but after Henry Tudor's victory (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1485</b>) , it reverted to the other
(Lancastrian/Tudor) side.         From <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535 </b>to<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1539</b>, there had been drawn out attempts by Cerne Abbey to resist full Dissolution   but it was finally
closed by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1540</b>. The Commissioners had been instructed to seek our evidence of 'monastic abuse' (throughout the country) as
a pretext to close and appropriate  such
Abbeys and all their properties
forthwith (some from as early as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1533</b>).         While John Bartelot/Bartlett  had been sometimes a little too proactive in
obtaining such evidence of  misdeeds, gaining some disapproval from Cromwell for same, the latter Overseer seems
nevertheless to have continued to treat John with considerable tolerance'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> This may have related to his
friendship with Sir John Tregonwell <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">and</b>
to the incriminating evidence that
others had, in any caase,  in any case,
already  obtained   regarding
the Abbot and deputies at Cerne Abbey. (This  concerned a long catalogue of recorded immorality there
with local 'girls'.) It was finally
closed by Sir John Tregownell   on 15 March,<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1539</b>. The full break with
Rome followed soon after and, by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b>,
most of  the property so acquired by the
Crown had been  're-distributed' by Tregonwell and Bartlett -
often to  family and friends). Thus,-in Cerne, all the buildings and lands
were eventually Leased out by the Crown to-.-a succession of different people, each of whom sought to make
a quick profit.- (ie by quick re-leasing
 'turnovers' to other friends and
relatives presumably.) It appears that
such transfers of Leasehold ownership were too quick and frequent to always  be properly recorded in the associated manor
records   with the latter sometimes
conveniently misplaced or 'lost'. [See now the entry above discovered in the
Patent Rolls on Muston.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> In any case, with all the
activities that John and Robert Bartlett
were no doubt still involved in at this time (including apparently the purchase
(and re-sale?) of many other minor
properties' Leases), one would assume
that neither Bartlett would reside at Muston itself (they already
having homes in neighbouring
Piddleton), nor operate its Farm, but would simply put in or continue with <u>a
known local Farmer  (Yeoman</u>) - as a Manager
(Copyholder). It was our initial
understanding that this may, at some <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">early</i></b> point, have been our
 <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William
Churchill</b> (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1490</b>-ca?<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1583</b>)
and/or his younger sons (William Jnr and
Richard - who would  both be 'of age' by
the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545 </b>or<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>so). But, it appears that the<u> Lowman family</u>
already had such roles in Piddlehinton   possibly  including Muston,  and may haveresumed same somewhat
later (after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1550, </b>say). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Thus, in the Will of Henry Lowman, Yeoman of Piddlehinton (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1581</b>),
he states -- I give the moiety of my<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> farm</i> called Mustertonne, otherwise
called 'the <u>farme</u> of Muston', to my wife [Alice Lowman] to have and to hold the (Lease of) said farm (not
the Manor or its house) during her life, and I give the other moiety unto my
son John [Lowman] the elder, and after [my wife's] decease, the whole (Farm) <u>Lease</u>
to remain unto my said son John Lowman (Jnr), and the Executors of my said
Leases.- There is no reference to <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Muston Manor, Hall or  House</i> per se, however; such  Leaseholds (and even Copyholds) were often
inherited by their Holder's wife and/or sons - for their lifetimes, at least, in
turn.  The Lowmans appear to have been
Copyholders and/or  Leaseholders of land in many parishes in central Dorset owned originally by the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">de
la Lynde</b> and other families - from the early <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1500</b>s or before. They may,
therefore, have so 'held' Muston <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">farm</i> earlier, as well (as leased from Cerne Abbey or similar, who held the
Freeholds    originally 'of the Crown').
William Churchill and his sons may have benefited at Catherstone  or nearer Dorchester (ie at Pulston in  Charminster) around the earlier <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540-45

Bartletts in compiling their history
that the Dorset Churchills generally
were often close associates of themselves
 (and of other inter-married families as Martyns, Kellawys, Frekes and Prouts). We have thus noted that Dorchester's <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill </b> (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1518-1557</b>) was somehow able to purchase that ex-Chantry residence in Dorchester about this

'Eastworth' and 'Holwell'   while - the Priory of Hinton (in the other direction   Somerset) was itself
also of considerable size-and might have been expected <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

other words, there were several properties available for anyone deemed needy -
amongst family and friends of the Tregonwells and Bartletts.  There were apparently surviving title Deeds for Muston, at least - for the years <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545/6, 1556,  1586,  1592, 1607,

manor (as <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"> </i>being<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"> <u>othe</u>r</i> likely Leaseholders (only) there - of the farm, not
the Manor per se, or its House) - as they had proved to be in this position <u>for the neighbouring 'Manor <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Farm</i>
of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Piddlehinton' </b></u>   as shown in the latter's Manor Court records in Eton's archives. These have been long held at Eton College (being the post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Muston - located in the same one parish of Piddlehinton   were however formerly the properties of <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">two

 if  the Manor house had been  Leased to Collier and the farm to Lowman   virtually from that date (as the Lownans probably already farmed it, as
they did the farm of Piddlehinton  manor next door), one wouldn't assume that the Churchill's
presence there, as now described above,  had only occurred towards the end of that
century; This would imply that they were
only involved latterly - post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1570</b>,

made the point that such a collection of significant family names that had
accompanied the changing ownership Deeds for a given property (as Muston) as
witnesses, over such a considerable period, may have reflected their combined belief and support in the legitimacy of those transactions. (Might it have been suspect otherwise   if such willingness wasn't so forthcoming ?) They point to a similar form of 'overkill'  where a Marriage
Settlement of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1609, </b>which somehow involved Muston, as a guarantee ( that being one of the
years when its title Deeds were being  re-written, we may recall) were comparably reinforced by the inclusion
of a 'Party to the Settlement' - namely one Christopher Greye    seemingly a local Squire of trustworthy
standing at the time. (This person was apparently also
involved in arranging that a property
in Litton Cheney called Stanscomb was 'enfeoffed' to a later John and William Bartlett    by
which each may have acquired such as
a - knight's  fee (portion) of that property.  Litton was near other properties to be
occupied or owned by the Churchills and Martyns   at Little and Long Bredy -
just below Dorchester, or the Comptons just to the north-west.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would the Bartlett files - said to contain

Bartelot/Bartlett family's history by Peter Bartlett (given above) included
considerable reference to two useful sources of information on Dorset families during
 the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1500</b>s (as we have noted) - namely the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Militia Muster rolls </b>and<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>the<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> Subsidy Tax rolls</b>. The names of those recorded on same were taken  by Officials
on various dates during that century (as
well as before and later) and eventually deposited in the Public Record Office
(now National Archives).  They can be
examined there, rather tediously, but thankfully a few have  been transcribed and are available
elsewhere. One of these   for three Musters held in Dorset during the reign
of Henry VIII  have at least been  gratefully published - by one T.L. Stoate of Bristol, in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1978.</b> They have,, most
conveniently, also been Indexed there  -
for both the <u>Places</u> at which these Musters were held and by S<u>urnames</u> of those listed.  [I
haven't enquired yet whether anything similar has been produced in respect of
the Subsidy rolls. (This later checked; there <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">were</i> some, but sadly, none for Dorset, noted thus far).] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  One can thus gain a very quick picture of just where members of any given family may have attended such Musters, and thus  resided, in that county. They were  designed to determine how many 'Able men' were
available in the country as a whole  (aged
16 to 60) at times of possible conflict,
as well as what kinds and amounts of weapons or equipment they possessed.  Two of the dates covered were quite close together
- namely <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1539 </b>and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1542</b>, while the other was for <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1569,</b> a  generation later.  They seem  quite thorough but where data may be  lacking for one or other of those two earlier years, the other usually
provided the missing facts - then referred
to as the 'alternative' roll so  used for
the above purpose.  Under the surname of
 Bartelot,  Bartlett, and all similar spellings, we find
there were 30 entries in Dorset, for one
or other of these  two earlier Musters, but  just 8 for the later one.  For the Churchills, there were  only 11 entries for the earlier Musters and
just 3 for  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1569</b>.  It was indeed
generally much sparser in coverage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  My inclination was to examine firstly any Muster entries for Piddleton and
Piddlehinton. The entries are organised
in terms of <u>the Hundreds</u> of the county concerned (here Dorset) and
within these into their respective Tithings (rather than Manors or Parishes). Thus we find that Piddleton (then Piddletown) is a Tithing within a Hundred of that same
name, along with a dozen other such Tithings, and one 'Liberty' - Piddlehinton itself
(why so differently categorised is not made clear). The Muster in that Hundred was taken by George de la Linde and Roger Stourton, Esqs 
on September 28/29 <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1542</b>   for which the 'alternative
roll' was that previously taken in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1539</b>, where needed.  There were an amazing 48 different surnames
shown for Piddletown in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542</b>
Muster which, surprisingly, include no Bartletts  (however spelt) nor any combined with 'alias Hancock'. There were however two shown - as  'Hancocke' itself  - for a  John and Robert.   In the
'alternative roll' (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1539</b>), there
were again no Bartletts,  but
there were now <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">four</i> other men listed just
as 'Hancocke' - namely, a William, two
Richards and a Thomas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> We might reasonably assume that
all 6 of these 'Hancockes' were in fact
Bartletts. (as explained in the history above). But, in neither year were  there
any Churchills in  that Tything (reflecting  generally the
main Piddleton Manor and its surrounding
dwellings in that  larger parish). In the other 12 Tithings in this Hundred there were at least two other Bartletts
noted (spelt thus) - viz   a William in
Milborne St Andrews - and a Thomas in Tolpuddle - both appearing only in  their respective 'alternative rolls' (for <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1539</b>) - when no Hancockes appeared in
either. As noted elsewhere, Milborne was
quite near Pulston Manor at the north
end of Charminster.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> What do we find for neighbouring Piddlehinton
? This is not in the above Piddleton
Hundred (nor any other Hundred), as it was for some reason classed as a 'Liberty' - seemingly a
comparable category in its own right (like a small Hundred)    in which were  included only two  Tythings - the main one  called by that same name - which we assume
would  include Muston Manor and Farm (which
however are not mentioned in the slightest in the Muster record)   and a much
smaller one called  Little Piddle Tything.
 No Bartletts or Hancocks appear in
either,  nor Churchills (for either of
these two earlier years). This implies
that neither family resided  there then
(ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1540</b>) - at least with respect to
those able-bodies aged 16 to 60).  This
proviso would apply equally to Piddleton, and to all other results reported in
our survey. It seems that the Bartletts (and maybe some Churchills) did not
wish their abodesto be easily known at that time (ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1540</b>). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   There <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">were</i>  however names William 'Lomyn' and Henry
'Lomyg' listed for  Piddlehinton in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542 </b> and also a Thomas and George Lomyn in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1539</b>
   (when Henry was listed as 'Loman'.)  We take these all to be 'Lowman' as generally
depicted in the<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"> Piddlehinton </i><b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Manor Court</b>
records - seen at Eton - for these and
other years in the Tudor period -  post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535</b>. The latter records also did not
include anything for Muston Manor -in whatever Tything or Liberty it may or may
not have then been considered a part. Its pre-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1535</b>
records may have remained wherever those for Cerne Abbey or Christchurch Abbey ended
up and those for its <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">post-1535</b>
history should have been transferred with its changing ownership Deeds     from
the Bartletts in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1545</b>  until the <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Dorchester</i> Churchills - after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1610</b> or so, with many in
between. The earlier <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">Bradford Peverell</i> Churchills - in the early to mid-1<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">500</b>s   (as Roger and his son Mathew; or
even Roger's father William Churchill Snr) appear thus far not to have been
directly involved with Muston manor (in Piddlehinton  Tything (or parish) - whatever
its Freehold, Leasehold or Copyhold  condition  at the time - at least as depicted in the  described Muster records.  One also noted no Colliers/Collyers there then
either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> But, we <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">have</i> made some other '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">discoveries' </b>which do arise<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b> in terms of these same Muster records    for other Tyhings or Manors.  We had looked next for the distribution
of the mustered Churchills elsewhere in
Dorset. If there were none in Piddletown
Hundred (in any if <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">its</i> Tythings and
Parishes) where might they be ?    Do we find <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Roger Churchill</b> - who would be aged an appropriate 25 or so when
the earlier two Musters took place ?
Sadly, No  not in Bradford Peverell, at least, where we would assume he then
resided;  nor is there any obvious Esq of
<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">any</i> name occupying that Manor then depicted in those rolls. In its adjoining Muckleford 'sub-manor' (2 miles to the west), there were however the expected Copyholders
John, Thomas and Richard Churchill, and
a Richard Lye, in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542, </b> and, in the slightly earlier one of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1539</b>, two other  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">John</i> Churchills - likely Snr and Jnr - as well.  Richard Lye, with  the Churchills, were the only ones  possessing a horse and harness as part of their
range of  'equipment'.  [We recall that by means of litigation
records, the Lyes  appeared to be related
to these other Churchills (possibly cousins of the William
(born ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1490</b>), all  apparently coming from or near Rockbeare in Devon,
along with others then in Compton, in
Dorset - a little further west -nearer  Devon. (But some later discoveries could alter this conclusion).] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we find the main manor at Bradford Peverell now shows Lawrence Meggs listed -
then barely 16 - but not his father Nicholas Meggs (possibly over 60) - then
still the Squire there,  nor the latter's
wife Jane (nee Peverell ex-Churchill) - who lived to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1577</b>, or her son Mathew Churchill, then about 23 and soon to marry
(ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1567</b>) - probably then residing
in Dorchester. A Robert Churchill is now
listed in adjoining Muckleford, as are
two of the males of the Lye family. We may recall that our  later parish register entries of the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1570</b>s  for this parish) showed also two Robert Churchills
also residing there.  In Compton,  in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542</b>,
we find   another John Churchill, .again the only
one with the full kit of equipment and
weapons   and thus very possibly the main Copyholder there (rather than just an agricultural husbandman).  In <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1569</b>,
we find a Richard Churchill, likely the latter John's son, now in the Compton
muster. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

like that' ?  Or, did he confuse the branches of Churchills who were  later associated with Muston - albeit many
years after   ca 1620, say, with those who settled rather earlier being of Bradford Pverell and Charminster (with the

then. It could well have been
Pulston   being in Charminster immediately next to Bradford Peverell (where
his son Roger would very likely have settle briefly with his wife Jane Peverell

Muston in any case   from Winston knowing a little about the albeit<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> <u>later</u></i><u> Dorchester family</u>  having  a connection with such a Manor   in that
general region. There is no reason not to assume that our missing William Churchill Snr - father of
Roger and John (and others) would not be <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">that</i>
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William Churchill</b> - then of nearby <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Pulston
Manor</b> in 1542 - if and until shown otherwise. The only other William Churchill extant at
that time resided in Dorchester - at Colliton House. He had
no reason to reside at Pulston then -
being either too young or otherwise occupied in his role in town. One has
increasingly concluded that any seeming association of Roger and John Churchill
- via their immediate forefather(s   (unknown to Winston)    with the Munston/Muston manor, most likely arose due to his uncertainty over  the relevant generations' names and  timings. It was a virtual blank in his
understanding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we have alluded several times above to this possibility of Pulston manor being
relevant in our hunt for this elder William's residence at around this period -
without citing our source. This arose once we had checked those  Muster Rolls  more latterly   but inserted the resultant possibility once discovered into our <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">earlier

son William Jnr (born as early as ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1525</b>,
say, could be on one side or the other
of the lower age limit for  mustering in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542</b>. His  next son Richard would more
likely have been a little  too young (but
these are guesses).  One wonders if there were any surviving parish
church registers for this manor, or would the relevant events only be
registered with  those for Charminster church - where the death (and/or
burial) of William's daughter-in-law Jane was certainly later registered   in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

case, we examine next the Muster for <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Little

us   with  some Churchill listings.  We find there in fact <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

sons (born later than Roger or John).  And, interestingly, we find four  members of the Martyn fzmily - Thomas, John,
Nicholas and  Richard  residing there as well. The first two listed
had the full range of equipment, including a horse each.  We may remind ourselves of the comments so
often made in the Bartlett history of the
remarkable numbers of times the families of Bartlett, Churchill, Martyn,
Kellaway  and Freke or Tregonwell occur together in various parishes and manors
(without any explicit basis  suggested
for same, but the influence of John 'Bartelot alias Hancocke' could conceivably have taken various forms from slight to major. These two Churchills could well be the younger
sons of the William Churchill of Pulston

parish; or Subsidy Tax evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

particular hypotheses as to how, if at all, the common presence of those with
these same 3 or 4 surnames can be accounted for. It would seem however not too
unlikely, in light of comments proferred in the Bartlett history,  that the Bartletts (and possibly the Martyns)
would be in positions to help the
Churchills, and others, in ways that are
less than simply granting them full
property rights or very reasonable sales prices. There may have been some inter-marriage of course. Those facilitating any such advantages  would likely have benefitted  equally themselves.  This same scenario would seem to be
relevant with respect  to other parishes and manors  to be described

Bonde. Sadly, no date was shown - other
than again  being somewhere between <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1553</b> and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

for the case, the more likely the
William Churchill concerned would be he of Dorchester (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541-1601</b>)   not aged 21+, ay, until ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1562+ </b> and not his apparent grandfather (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1490-1570+</b>),
or that man's third son - both William Churchills (Snr and Jnr) .  But, he wouldn't have been either of those
latter two Williams of  the earlier Little
Bredy <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">musters</i> either   as the younger
Dorchester man was only born about  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541</b>. We must enquire therefore what might be any common denominator as
between the earlier and  the later William Churchill associated with Lt Bredy ?  (Mellers and Bondes<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> were</i> of course more likely associated with the later Dorchester family.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in this regard:  (1) the later William's
son John married  Eleanor, a daughter of
John.Meller  of Lt Bredy' ( the surname
of one of the Defendants)  and (2) I have
seen reference to Cerne Abbey having
property interests in both the Cerne valley manors (including Pulston) and even in Muston (in neighbouring Piddle
valley)  <u>as well as in (oddly
distant) <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

further afield - near Cranborne   much to the east.  These aspects
could all be linked  OR, it is possible
that it was only a coincidence and  that
William Churchill of Dorchester's concern related <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

Churchill or family at Lt Bredy <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">may</i>
have simply been a coincidence   of  which the Dorchester William  may himself  never have been aware. If  it  wasn't, there could well be reference in the
details of that C3/ case indicating some connection between these  two Williams (and a common property interest -
quickly turned around)  rather than it being
due entirely to the Meller link, and to <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">their</i>
earlier property there.     <o:p></o:p></span></p>

themselves where the expected elder John Churchill (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1518-1557</b>), the foregoing younger William's father, and his
possible  brother-in-law John Bond
both appear    in St Peter's parish   the former with the
full kit, as it were.  There were no
Churchills in same nor in the other two
Dorchester parishes, nor were any
Martyns or Bartletts apparent in these Dorchester
 musters either. Many families preferred the
quieter manor life of the countryside, if not involved in commerce or the ambitions of local public office. They
avoided Dorchester.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_align:left"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> We now return north of Dorchester
again but a little to the north-west of Pulston manor (and
of its more northerly neighbours Forston and Godmanston) to consider Frampton Tything  - home latterly of a very wealthy family    the Brownes (but previously held by the---.. s
and/or a religious order (?Cerne) but  was bought out by this former and successful Yeoman
family of Browne; whether they too  profited
by knowing the Bartletts in obtaining that property is yet to be investigated). Unsurprisingly, the first entry is for the
then head of that huge household (and Manor) <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Browne, Esq </b> - who sports no less than '5 Harnesses furnished, 5 Bills and Bows,  and Arrow sheaves to
match. But, more to our own point, the turnout there included a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill</b>,
 as well as Robert Bartletts, Snr and Jnr,
John Bartletts,  Snr and Jnr,  and a
William Bartlett,   as well as  William
and Thomas Martyns ! There will be
descriptions later of some connection between the Frampton Bartletts and those later
in the Somerset branch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

similar range of these family names was Compton Valence (in Compton Tything)
where there was another <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">William Churchill</b>,
accompanied this time by a John, Henry,
Richard, Robert and William Bartlett !  It was as though when  'John Bartlett alias Hancocke' was sharing his
bounty or influence around (in whatever form),  it went to his own relatives (including
cousins) <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">and</i> to those of  his Churchill and Martyn friends (or cousins!)
 - in several locations  probably at levels below actual Freehold
grants, purchase  or reduced rents - but
rather , as temporary Leaseholds    soon
slod on.  [It may well be instructive to  inspect all those Crown property transaction details which Peter Bartlett said
were simply too voluminous to include in his own history itself;  (ie see Class E 310-390, etc record). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Churchills' places of residence in Dorset  before and after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

questions than answers. But, we do have the
statement that Muston manor <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">was</i></b> held by the (earlier?) Churchills
by Leasehold  (ca mid-century) ; that
is,  seemingly <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

outright from ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1586</b> to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1612) - </b>possibly piecemeal<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">. </b> We also rely heavily on the  likely reason why a Churchill bought Louvard
fields in the first place   in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1586</b>
- of all possible rural property then available  in Dorset. Surely it was because a very significant <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">earlier</i> Churchill (?progenitor) had been
long connected with Muston manor immediately next door. We also now have evidence of  the presence of a William Churchill in a
neighbouring Manor -in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Pulston</b>   in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542 </b>(with a John Bartlett also
residing there - wishing to avoid Piddleton?<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

evidence of  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

near both Bartletts and Martyns in those  same earlier years just souside of  of Dorchester).  What we do lack is a clearer picture
of the lines of descent of all the those
contemporary Churchills and Bartletts so discovered !<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

and Church Register data will one day help
clarify these matters in time.  Being in
Charminster parish, one would assume that there should be  some parish church entries recorded for r any early

early manor court records extant for Pulston - but they oddly cease around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1477</b>. Was Cerne Abbey  of relevance ? There are, I believe, one or two PRO documents of possible interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for most English counties, from much earlier times, in which the College interviewed the senior
members of all landed families (with Arms) to update their family pedigrees   every generation or so. The information would be given by the senior (or
most available) member of the family concerned then resident in the given
county. The results for Dorset in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1623</b> is available on the Internet - but
as transcribed in a very condensed format with  many Latin
abbreviations. The status of the
Churchill and Peverell families were
included - but seemingly in a rather partial or incomplete form. That
for the Churchills was provided solely by the above <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Churchill descent proceeding directly to
 John, Duke of Marlborough. via John and
Winston of Wooton Glanville etc.  Some
had moved on - to London.   <o:p></o:p></span></p>

by William Churchill of Dorchester)  again begins  in mid-air as it were
 with  the earlier John Churchill of Dorchester (d. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1557</b>) appearing as from nowhere.
Nothing is mentioned about his  father - the earlier William Churchill   or the
later John's apparently older brother Roger (by then long dead), or his
parallel issue initially in Dorset, and later in London. The family's Coat of Arms <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">was</i> mentioned    described verbally. Some descendants, after
Roger,  Mathew, and Jasper Snr did reside
at times in London but I'm not certain if there were comparable Visitations for
same in those years; if so, they seem to be very incomplete. [Yes, there was a Visitation
of London in  about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

Westminster.   For the Peverells, there were a few first
names given for Dorset) but no dates or
relationships.  It did show a very brief
entry  simply:  'Jane===Megges'  (provided by whom?)  and the name Nicholas Megges appeared just once,
elsewhere, but, again, without any

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">.         If some of the foregoing describes the family situation and events in  Dorchester at least   for those descended from the Yeoman;s seeming second
son John Snr, who had settled there, we enquire also about any issue from Roger,
and from William Jnr,  respectively - ie
John's next two immediate brothers (as understood). As noted, we've concluded that Roger (b ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1515-16</b>) married Jane Peverell (b ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1518-20</b>) about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538-40 </b> and had a first surviving son Mathew, possibly
in Bradford Peverell, (if not in Sherborne) soon after, (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1544-47</b>). Jane would strongly appear to have then married,
only <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">secondly</i>, Nicholas Megges -  after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1552

Lawrence, generally shown as born <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">about</i>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         The other brother William of this generation (ie as the
Yeoman's apparent third son)  is thought
to have been born about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1525-30  </b> but
we can see none of that name still living at the time of second brother John's <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1557 </b>Will; although we do find that a previously unrealised brother '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Rowland' Churchill</b>  surprisingly mentioned; but there appears to
be no prior or later evidence of this man's existence or where he fitted into the sequence of births of his assumed
siblings. Any information regarding his origins would obviously assist our understanding. Nor is Roger mentioned in that Will, but more
 understandably  as he had died about 5 years before John wrote it. Other possible brothers Richard and
Alexander (seemingly born laterca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1530-35</b>,
say) have also been mentioned. Thus, a <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Richard Churchill</b> is noted as one of the Overseers to John's Will of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1557</b>;
where else could he have appeared from ? And an Alexander is mentioned once or

reference to the Will of John Churchill 1
of Dorchester (c<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1518-20 -1557</b>),
there have been many noteworthy and
prominent members of that one branch of the family subsequently who continued
to serve in local and national positions (mentioned above). We have  described these briefly before continuing with our primary goal - of
delineating their cousin line - as descended in parallel from John's brother <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">Roger Churchill</b> (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1515-16 
ca 1552</b>)   via Mathew and Jasper Churchill.  Both  of Roger's
 dates are estimates based on
circumstantial evidence. They suggest that Roger could have been considering marriage from
around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1538 </b> 
when he would be about 25 or so. Who knew, in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1530</b>s, say, about Jane Peverell being a sole heiress to a deceased
father - William Peverell - of Dorset ?  Is Sherborne relevant ? I have seen reference to William Peferell being
from 'Bardolfeston' - intriguingly just east of  Piddleton.                     Was Roger there ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1542 </b>?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

noted (somewhere)  that a start was
apparently  made in transferring the
Freehold ownership of the Muston property, from the Bartletts to the Churchills, as early as the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1560</b>s (details sadly misplaced), although
for whatever reason this (intended early transfer) wasn't finalised until <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1612 - </b>after various intervening transfers. <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> </b>By this date,<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> </b>both
William the Yeoman and his elder sons Roger and  John had died -  Roger about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

father apparently (or allegedly) not dying
until <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1583</b>, aged an impressive 93   but again leaving no
Will. If William Snr's third son William
Jnr  (ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

transfer of a Copyhold (being the son of the Farmer), it  may
have been  John 1's eldest son William 2 (ca
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1541-1602</b>) <u>of Dorchester</u> who might  then assume
some related interest or oversight - possibly of both properties - at Muston
(as Copyhold) and Dorchester.(as
Freehold) - with his eldest son in turn - the Clothier-cum-Barrister John
Churchill (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1568-1621</b>);  latterly 'of Stinsford' and, .finally , 'of
Muston' - being the one who finally
completed the latter's Freehold purchase   in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

two fields next to Muston, at Nouvard /Norford in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

shown by  a word that was quite  indecipherable (by myself) but appeared something like 'Addn's'   which is not at all like 'Mathew;s', for  example, nor anything else I can easily
imagine (although '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

(after a stint at Oxford from ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1608) </b>- just after his cousin John (of the Dorchester Churchill)  completed their purchase of Muston.   This
would be after attending Grammar School (ca

Jasper Jnr had likely missed - unless something like 'scholastic day-release' was part of his  apprenticeship scheme in London that early. He  would normally board with his Master (Richard
Ball) for the necessary 6  years. Interestingly, older brother John would<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">  begin
</i>his training just about as Jasper was <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">finishing his</i> (and beginning
 to earn some  money). Maybe they lodged together ? After all, when he applied to Middle Temple, John described himself as already : <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

did  very well - after their London

and Middle Temple  where  he was admitted a student on 15 March <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

general manner, demeanour and bearing - albeit at just 18 - may have supported his answer to any

 the first son of  this John Churchill (later of Wooton Glanville,
Esq)    namely, the first Winston Churchill
(who was born to him in London), was
described in his  associated biography in that History, rather patronisingly,
 as having  'constructed his own impressive pedigree'  but that (actually)  -his grandfather (unnamed) -was a 'Copyholder' .-   'Yes', that
grandfather  (Jasper Snr) or even the
latter's  father Mathew, in turn,  may well have been so styled in their youth
(or even as a Husbandman) -but one who nevertheless
managed to have one son educated to become a  Barrister  and another to become  a member of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers' and thus  'Citizen of London'   whose  older son in turn   - 'Sir
John Churchill'   would  also entered
Middle Temple and one day became 'Master of the Rolls.  Some Copyholder; some Pedigree  and <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> not</i>  'constructed'  ! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Roger when he was but 6 or 7 (as an only son) and Jasper Snr himself, also an
only son,  losing   his   father  Mathew,  in turn,  when  of
similar young age or younger !   Things could certainly have been a lot easier for
both boys  - as it had been for those in
the Dorchester  family. Mathew's father in turn (Roger) was of
course, if briefly, a Freeholder of his
own Manor - at Bradford Peverell   through his wife Jane Peverell   who was early left a widow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

up, dust themselves off  (with some adult
help) such that ,Jasper (or even Mathew, as first a 'Husbandman. and later a  'Copyholder) indeed thrived !  Oh, and Winston's  son became the Duke of Marlborough, while  Winston himself became a founding  member
of the Royal Society !  Quality it seems, and pedigree, will indeed ultimately
be manifested  (despite ?Mathew or Jasper
having to work for a time, seemingly, as a Blacksmith, but later as  a Tailor, and another as a Cutler). The author of the Parliamentary biography
could have chosen a more accurate and less patronising description of Winston. The Great Domesday Book (and other later
records) do show the gradual evolution of the Norman name 'de Courcelle' to 'Churchill' through the 11<sup>th</sup> to
16<sup>th</sup> centuries.    <o:p></o:p></span></p>

 <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1610</b>s,
 these two brothers were thus both in a
position to marry -probably in London.  Initially, I had no knowledge regarding what
occupation if any their father Jasper Snr  had followed    back in Dorset  presumably - during those difficult years
around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1600-20</b>, say, nor when the elder Jasper died - possibly
around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1630 </b>or so; that is,  before the chaos of the
Civil war began to dominate.  [Of course,
I had discovered that Jasper Snr had in fact become a Tailor - of Bradford
Peverell   by about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1588,</b> as
explained above.]  He  and
wife Elizabeth (nee 'Chaplet'  Chapell?)  likely resided later near his mother  Alice (nee Gould)  in Dorchester.  It was, I believe, he or even his father
Mathew (not his younger son) who was
once described as a 'Husbandman' or even as a Blacksmith as a youth   on Copyhold
land - likely on  the Bradford Peverell
(?Muckleford),  Pulston,  or even  the Herringston estate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Barrister, would in any case, soon marry well   the daughter Elizabeth  of an established west-country (Gloucestershire)
family   the Winstones, while his younger son Jasper Jnr, the Cutler (b ca<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1592</b>) apparently married an Alice (surname unknown)     also
in London  -  around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1618-20</b>.
 [Note: there is a PCC Will in the name
of am Ellis Churchill - yet to be examined.] He then repeated his father's order of  naming his sons - with John (eventually
knighted) and Jasper (3),  born in that order
- in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1620 </b>and<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1626, </b>respectively, with a son Thomas Churchill

a Cutler - of fine knives and even of ceremonial swords in those times  Jasper Snr would have to begin by learning how to heat and beat metal to the extent
that it becomes amenable to shaping and
annealing (before sharpening) - that is,
very much like a 'country Blacksmith' ! Did young Jasper become intrigued in

actually fulfilled such a Blacksmith's role   as between Roger, Mathew or Jasper Snr- when writing in that 'common-place diary'  later in
the possession of a former Duke of Portland (as quoted by the earlier Winston Churchill)

by Purchase and recommendation   from an existing member, I believe.  But, we have seen the entry for his
Appreticeship details which confirmed that status was indeed obtained by training   under the

leave a Will - dated <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">164849</b>. In  it,
 he  refers to his then (and I believe only) wife  Alice (nee-?-) and  his known three sons    John, Thomas and Jasper 3, and one daughter
Sarah (bn ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1628</b>)-  to each of whom he left  &pound;50 'as
each turned  24', and to his wife (Alice)
 &pound;200. - to be invested in
securities'. Eldest son John (the
budding  lawyer and knight to be) appears
to be the only one not left such a  direct legacy <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:

Accounts of financial transactions between Jasper and a large number of often aristocratic
Creditors to whom he had apparently lent money over the previous several years
and for which many valuables, fully listed, had been deposited with him as
collateral. These, and the loans thus
covered, amounted to  very significant
sums - running to Thousands of Pounds
(possibly in excess of &pound;50,000. overall). [In today's  terms, it would no
doubt  be worth several millions - truly.]   The  accompanying text in Latin simply described
the accounts as representing pertinent aspects of the Administration of the

Churchill,  who became ill on 4 Dec <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1677</b> and quite soon died at his house on The Strand  on  17  Dec that year. She reported this to the necessary authorities and requested they come
to identify and register the extent and value of all that property -

on our prime subject <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">John Churchill</b>,
(b <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1650</b>) son of the earlier Winston
of Roger's line.  After the Commonwealth
decade, Winston  (grandson of Jasper
Churchill 1) became, as noted, the MP
for Weymouth, Dorset and was soon  knighted
himself   in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1664</b>.  This honour preceded that accorded his cousin John
Churchill (Master of the Rolls) who was himself knighted in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1670.</b>   In <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Chapter 2</b> of his book, our modern Sir
Winston Churchill then describes the nature of the new Royalist-dominated
society that so completely and quickly replaced that of the Puritans and Cromwell
in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1660</b>. The return to the 'old ways' was effected
with amazing speed - with all power and
influence again devolving from the King and his close family but in relatively flexible
ways (compared to that in the French court, under Louis 14<sup>th</sup>,  said to still be  more  centralised
and  rigid).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> [Something here about the Baronies and how
many were also held by Bishops and above. The church and its hierarchy were thus still very wealthy (and
powerful) - from the start (see Internet accounts). Religion, like Royalty,  was a controlling force and a constant  reality to be considere and supported.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">    Thus,
says Churchill, 'nearly all chances of distinction and advancement went by way
of <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">royal favour</i>, but, importantly in
England, that favour was determined ultimately by <u>merit</u>' - which was
identified and recognised by means of all relevant sources of information
channelled eventually to the King through his most trusted advisers.  These channels were based on the recognised
merit and trust of those long-established families in the worlds of religion,
law, property and politics - usually reflected in their ancient <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Coats of Arms</b>. At both national and
county level, these most respected, often inter-married, families <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">were all well know to one another</i>; their
forebears for many generations had been carefully scrutinised, and their wealth
generally accounted for in terms of property, ability, ancient lineage - and reliable
loyalty to 'the system' (ie 'the establishment').  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt">    <span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:
115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Many like Winston Churchill had
remained loyal through very difficult times and Charles II, after his return,  sought to make amends as best he could with a
depleted treasury. This was. ironically,
 at least augmented by funds from
France   to ensure England's continued
support in her grander plans for Europe. The new English parliament was thus
stocked with the often young sons of those loyal adherents so had to remain for
some time (18 years in a single 'long parliament'!)  as they matured with increasing experience 
for which Charles II said he was 'quite patient to await'.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

families who had lost their estates - both in England and Ireland.  Winston was an active MP in these regards
during<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1660</b> and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">'61</b>, as well as later dealing with the House of Lords in promoting
their cooperation in establishing a renewed Army (as reported May 10, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1662</b>). But the settlements of many grievances in Ireland at that time (then a
full member of the Union) was being clogged up by countless difficulties and
the initial committee of 36 men set up to resolve them was disbanded (having
too many personal interests in Ireland themselves) and a new one chosen by the King's chief
advisers - composed of just 7 men of known integrity and competence replaced them in over-seeing this 'Court of
Claims'. Winston Churchill was one of
those chosen 7 - possibly effected through the 'good offices' of an important friend
in high places   one Sir Henry Bennett, later Lord Arlington, whose influence
had first ecured his introduction to 'the Court' in Whitehall' and who would
continue to be influential with both the Court and Parliament in future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dublin in July<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

and so in need of more formal schooling. He was soon admitted to Dublin's 'Free Grammar School' where he would
obtain a quite adequate early education for the next two years. But, by December <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1663</b>, Winston's committee complained of the slow progress,
frustration  and utter fatigue being
experienced. He wrote to Lord Arlington
asking if he could possibly return home for a  two months  break   for a well needed rest. This was not only granted but, once home, he
was given a new position in the Royal Household (on the Board of Green Cloth)
which oversees placement of staff in same) and, in addition, received a

place as an army Ensign   through some such contact 'at Court' and thought it
odd that the foundation to his later military and diplomatic success hadn't
been (in part at least) by way of some more favoured <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">educational</b> background     something generally denied to the vast bulk of
young people in those times. When it appeared
later that it wasn't as a<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> military</i> Ensign
initially but as a <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">cour</i>t Page through
which he first got a foot in the Royal door, that educational advantage still
seemed oddly lacking. However, we find
that the timing of the return to London for Winston and family, with his new
position and honour, would prove most fortuitous. For 14 year old John Churchill
soon obtained a place  at St Paul's
School, one of the best of the few 'Public Schools'  already well established in :London. A house was  thus soon purchased in the City within walking
distance of the school where he was a  day pupil for the next two or three important
years.  Odd to think that a Jasper Churchill, described ca
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1665-70</b>  as being of 'The Strand' so nearby, (and shortly
to be the subject effectively of an Inquisition post mortem) - was someone of
whose existence or relevance young John Churchill may or may not have been aware  'Ships in the night' - of different
generations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   Meanwhile, Winston's first born and John's
older sister, Atrabella, had, a little before this, turned 16 (in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1665</b>) and the role of patronage would
again come to the rescue. The wife of
James, Duke of York (the Duchess), needed another 'maid of honour' in her personal
household and the position was offered to and accepted by Arabella (and by her
parents, of course). It was recognised
as a major placement of influence and security for her and her family's
future. It was not long before the Duke
(the future King James II) took affectionate note of Arabella's beauty and figure.  If her brother was at all concerned for her 'honour',
as some apparently implied  later that  he possibly should have been, it was pointed
out by John's future wife Sarah Churchill (many years later) that as a school
boy at the time, 'still being whipped for not reading his book', there was nothing he could possibly have done
about it, had he wanted  to.  As it transpired therefore, Arabella would,
after <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1668</b> or so) become the Duke's favoured
mistress and would bear that  future King
a son    'James Fitz-James' (amongst
others), who became Duke of Berwick, a Marshall of France and a military victor
on his own account - as at the battle of Almanza.  Arabella later married very well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">           The morality of these arrangements at that
level of society then was more than simply tolerated, it was an accepted reality of life and actively sought after. The Kings' wives were, after all, all chosen
politically to bear heirs and solidify allegiances. They may not necessarily
have been particularly 'pliant and warm' (say).  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">     By <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1666</b>,
Winston's trusted services were again required in Ireland however   to continue
the commission's remit to resolve the issues of property claims there. He decided to return their without the family,
who continued living in London. John had
reached a point at 16 when he would have to consider his own future. Many young gentlemen of adequate education would
enter one of the Inns of Court at about that point (often at 18) for legal
training - if only to better handle the affairs of any inherited estates to
come, or to become a fully practising lawyer, as did his grandfather - and/or enter one of the two universities  of Oxford or Cambridge - generally to prepare
for a position in the church. But,
again, with the advantage of Winston's patron Lord Arlington*, that position in
the Court with the Duke of York - as a Page   was soon provided. The future potential advantages of this were
apparently considered superior to those other two alternatives and it was thus taken
up that same year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  [ * It
would seem relevant to determine the basis of this important early friendship and
patronage   between Winston and the former Sir Henry Bennett; later, as Lord Arlington,
he would prove a most important and pivotal ally and power broker.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          Meanwhile,
Winston continued in Dublin until <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1669</b>
including a phase there when he became rather frustrated in coping with agents
of  his children's patron, the Duke of
York, who kept seeking control of Irish properties allegedly promised to them  by the King   formerly owned by some of those
responsible for the execution of their father Charles I in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1649</b> ! He felt that they
were however often over-stepping the mark and told them so. But the Duke was seemingly so pleased with
Winston's qualities otherwise, and those of his children, in his and his wife's
service, this was soon ignored. Indeed,
on one occasion, the Duke, who was much involved with his role in maintaining
the fitness and competence of both the Army and Navy asked young John Churchill
one day where he saw his future. John
replied instantly that he would very much like to gain entry into one of <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">the senior army Regiments</i>. We should
recall that his own father had been a Cavalier Captain serving the previous King;
despite earlier law qualifications. John would have heard many stories of his
action in the recent war. Also, he was
apparently an active, energetic lad who would be less content in any indoor
role - as in the law. He duly became an
Ensign in the Army (in the Life Guards regiment) by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1668
</b>   as a first step in this chosen
path, then aged about 18.         <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   Prior to this decision and its immediate consequences,
we may note that while still a Page at the Court, ,he already had some
influence and useful contacts there   by
virtue of three well placed ladies.  His
sister was, as noted,  a Maid of Honour
to the Duchess of York and a confidante of the Duke (the King's brother) while
his 2<sup>nd</sup> cousin, once removed, Barbara nee Villiers, had become the
King's first mistress. (The Villiers had
been close to  royal families for some
generations.) Finally, this latter lady
had a close friend in John's aunt  (his
mother's sister) of the Drake family - seemingly also well acquainted with
royalty. John would have met them all when
visiting his aunt or in Barbara's own rooms at the Palace.  She
was about 8 years older than still young John Churchill and had already borne
the King, who remained infatuated with her for many years, 5 children before
she was 25. Initially, she treated John
as one would a young cousin she saw from time to time in the company of her
best friend, John's aunt.  Once set on
his career in the Army, John appeared at Court less often but did know many
people there and no doubt showed up at times  in his smart new uniforms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">           Such young
future officers were expected to gain some foreign experience in the services
and he soon volunteered for a posting with his regiment to Tangiers - held by
the British through some agreement with Spain as an outpost from which to
control Algerian pirates, on their 'Corsairs', interfering with British shipping
in the Mediterranean.   He stayed there an impressive 2 -  years - to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1670</b> - entailing some active fighting experience as Tangiers was frequently
attacked .  He did not return home
directly, however, as his services were still needed in a naval capacity
searching out those pirates elsewhere in the Mediterranean and in an attack on
their headquarters in Algiers. He thus
gained further  experience as a
young officer at sea, engaging in such
actions, for some months.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         He seems to have arrived back
home in January <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1671</b> and was soon
being admired by all the ladies of the Court in his latest uniform, bronze tanned
 and with  stories of his adventures, not least by Barbara
Villiers, now 29 to John's 21. The strong
attraction was mutual. Between <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1671 </b>and<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1675</b>, <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"> before</i> he met his future wife Sarah
Jennings, John Churchill was Barbara Villiers' sole lover. She had been created Duchess of Cleveland
and was independently very well off herself.  Her affair with the King was now over and
completely dormant and she bore just one more child, a daughter   for whom John was the acknowledged putative
father. There is no suspicion that he
ever had any other affairs or loves after subsequently meeting Sarah   when he
was 24   to whom it is generally agreed he
was totally devoted, as she was to him, for the rest of their lives. This was
universally recognised, admired. and  unquestioned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;tab_stops:21.3pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          There are just two or three recorded snippets
of information by which we may monitor John Churchill's non-military life
during those 4 socially indulgent years (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1671-'75</b>). Thus, he was reported in some Gazette of the
times that he was involved in two separate duels, being injured in the arm in
one. They occurred in early and late <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1671</b>, against a Mr. Fenwick and a  Mr Herbert, respectively.  The subject of the
challenges and by whom is not given. It
may reflect our understanding of John Churchill's adventurous and risk-taking
nature.  The other item has a less
confirmed character but was a generally understood occurrence a little later -
around <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1673</b> - pertaining to his
sudden departure from Barbara's apartments one evening as the King was
approaching and, to save her embarrassment, he jumped successfully down to a
courtyard below.  In appreciation, she allegedly
provided him with a &pound;5000. reward - knowing in any case that he had recently extolled to her the benefits of
a potential investment in  a form of Life
insurance Annuity then being promoted by
Lord Halifax - an acknowledged honourable man. A sum of &pound;4,500 would guarantee a later  annuity for life worth &pound;500. a year. (One could live comfortably on &pound;50 at that
time.)   He so invested (on 30 April <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1674</b>) and did benefit from same reliably
over many future years such that some say it was the  foundation of his  family's later  fortune and wealth. [One mustn't forget that at that time ,
another Churchiill, (Jasper 3) was (independently) becoming very wealthy himself.]   <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          During this 4 year period in his early 20s, John
would also have continued gaining in experience with his Regiment (the Life
Guards) in various  manoeuvres and
actions - at home and abroad. - when not advancing his contacts socially with
all and sundry around Court (at St James Palace) and Whitehall (government) circles.  More
active military experience was thus
provided, in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1672</b>, just after his 22<sup>nd</sup>
birthday.  This action, the first since
Tangiers, was seemingly a rather minor affair. to be described below .but only
after first putting into context the entire complex situation in Europe at that
time. This entailed a masterful
summation by our author Winston Churchill of the overall scene into which John
Churchill would soon find himself increasingly involved.  The one over-riding fact that affected the
latter part of the 17<sup>th</sup> century in Europe, stressed Churchill, was
the over-powering might, ambition  and
wealth of France. She had become much
richer, better organised and of greater population than all other major nations
in Europe just then. But this reality was
complicated by the roles of the  secondary
powers as well. Who was an ally with
whom and who the enemy ?  How to gain and hold power, influence and
wealth ?  It was ever thus in Europe.  Diplomacy and trust were  crucial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:21.3pt;text_indent:21.25pt"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  In his account of this situation, Churchill
devotes 25 long paragraphs (all of his Chapter Four) in setting out this
complicated background. (It is this historical
aspect of which I felt I had very little appreciation and why I was attracted
to reading  the biography.)  This
is then followed in Chapter Five and beyond by an extensive account of John
Churchill's subsequent military and diplomatic career when he interacts with
this complex military-political-religious-diplomatic reality, mainly on the
Continent   between <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1672</b> and  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1676,</b>
initially, and then again many years later (post-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1700</b>) - to even greater effect and honour. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  We begin by attempting to condense the
background of this tumultuous and complex period to its key elements. It will necessarily be incomplete but should
provide the general context of that  quarter
century and so allow a better perspective of John's initial involvements     ie in the
'hows and whys', of  it
all. We now have a copy also of an article on the 'Franco-Dutch
wars' of this period  (time of Charles II);
which slightly preceded those later conflicts -  described by.our present Churchill  as  'the
wars of William and Anne'  but, as
concluded later, also to become known as  '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">the
20 Year War'</b>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   When
Churchill noted in his biography that the key reality of this period of English
history was the over-powering position of France, he might have included a
comment about the near equal position of Holland - at least in the Naval and
trading sphere. For the entire backdrop  to our account of John Churchill would be
played out essentially in terms of the conflicts between these two competing
states (if soon involving England as well - supporting now one and now the
other)  and how that would serve to
determine his own future military role). Without that on-going conflict, we may
never have heard about a Duke of Marlborough. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   These
two nations had previously recognised their mutual interests as early as the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1560</b>s when they formed an impressive Alliance
that lasted a century - to the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1660</b>s.
While Louis XIV was irritated by Holland s Republicanism, Protestantism and
their Trading rivalry, he realised that a continued military alliance with them
was in France's own best interests. But,
eventually, in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1668</b>, the Dutch
decided to join a triple alliance   <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">with</i>
England and Sweden   to support Spain in their defence of the Spanish
Netherlands (now Belgium) against
France   which Louis had decided they
should take over on their northern border (next to Holland). Before
attempting to do so, however, they realised that they must now first subdue
Holland. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  To do this, he knew he would have to get
England to change sides - knowing that they had already had two wars with
Holland themselves (in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1652-54</b> under Cromwell and, more recently,  in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1665-67</b>).
- whom they too had seen as a great
naval and trading rival. To get them to
leave this new triple alliance, he would have to pay England an impressive 3 million
pounds annually  Amazingly, Sweden too
agree to support the invasion of Holland
by threatening Brandenburg-Prussia
across the Baltic if they should intervene on the side of the Dutch.  War was thus declared by <u>the French and
English</u>   against  Holland   on 7 April <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1672</b>. Morality in those days
was simply 'real politique'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

EARLY MILITARY CAREER</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         With the foregoing  as the background and context, we may now
examine John's early career, starting from a minor role in that first action  just off the Suffolk coast, at Sole Bay  in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1672</b>.
[We used to holiday near there in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>19</u></i>72</b> !] In  his
account of John's life and times, our modern day Churchill distinguishes two
major phases in the former's military career: an earlier 4 year period from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1672</b>
to<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1675</b> in which he rose swiftly
from mere Ensign to Colonel (by 25) - by his  general conduct, personal qualities of
confidence and the impression he made on all those of higher command in the
fields in which he first served so successfully.  The start of the second phase was very much
delayed however   until almost <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1700</b>
(as also noted briefly above). He was finally
then called upon to command the entire army of the Grande Alliance against
France through 10 major campaigns on the Continent   which he accomplished with
complete infallibility. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  His progress between these two phases was much
slower and difficult than that initial period may have promised, but he
persisted against various setbacks to have his true colours fully recognised
once again. In that earlier period, he
advanced from grade to grade  rapidly by
sheer ability, merit, and daring   that
was apparently recognised and needed at
the time. Later, there were many more
political and diplomatic hurdles to negotiate with the growing numbers of other
ambitious careers also seeking recognition and advancement.  He would
thus be 52 before he was finally in total command of the Grande Alliance army. But
then 'age' is just another name for 'experience'. We begin with that first
phase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         In early April <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1672,</b> the almost dormant Treaty of
Dover between France and England
(described above) was suddenly and unexpectedly re-activated by Louis XIV  when his armies, with English support, decided
to invade their then mutual enemy Holland across the Rhine (whose Naval power against their mutual commercial
interests was once again becoming more
than irritating and, as explained, France needed to neutralise her before she could
wrest Belgium Netherlands from Spain).  But Holland retaliated cleverly by flooding
their entire country, making it impossible to invade properly and take
control. The Alliance  withdrew in bewilderment. At first, it was
assumed by writers of the day that young Churchill, with so many other officers,
was a part of this combined force and limited action but it seems that he had in
fact been ordered  to take part in
another, even earlier 'surprise action'   on 13 March <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1672</b> - but at sea, against the Dutch fleet - who
were then at anchor off the Isle of Wight in southern England.  This equally treacherous action (their latest
war had still not been officially declared)  also failed and the bulk of the Dutch fleet
escaped. The regiment of soldiers
conveyed to the scene did include John Churchill on this occasion, with his best friend George Legge; who both took
part in the limited action (as though
Marines rather than Army soldiers).  John's conduct and character were not specifically
reported on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         Just as the English Army had
already joined forces with that of the French against the Dutch, so too had
their two Navies - the English contingent being commanded by  James, Duke of York (John's future patron). They and the French raced to the channel
near the Thames estuary to cut off the Dutch escape from that Isle of Wight
encounter (about late March that year) but were too late;  the
Dutch had already gained the wider North Sea and soon took up a defensive
position off their own coast. The combined English-French fleet then took up a
comparable position near the English coast off Suffolk with the intention of re-supplying themselves with needed men, provisions and
munitions   to the extent that a depleted Treasury and awkward Parliament could
afford or be willing to do so.  The Dutch
Admiral de Ruyter, appraised of the opposing fleets' preoccupied disposition wisely decide to attack - which he
did to deadly effect on May 28, <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1672</b>, In about 8 hours, they had effectively destroyed their enemies'
fleets. One ship, the Prince. had contained
about 600 of the Guards regiment of which more than 200 were killed or wounded.
 De Ruyter finally withdrew at dusk and
described the action as  the hardest he had experienced of the thirty two in which he had been engaged. The offensive power of both his and the enemy
fleets were significantly diminished for several weeks afterwards. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  John Churchill, one of those Guards on board, luckily
survived although four Captains in that Admiralty regiment had not and John's generally
brave conduct (as reported to the Duke of York), coupled with those vacancies, served jointly to recommend
him for a double promotion   from Ensign
to a Marine Captaincy in that Admiralty regiment.  It afforded him in addition a more personal protecting
role with respect to his ultimate patron, the Duke of York, who headed that
division. He had just turned 22. He returned to a welcoming Barbara Villiers -
proud to assist him in the required purchase of his new uniform and kit.  It would not be long before the continuing war
between the new allies (France and England) and their  Dutch  enemy would flare up again - in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1673/74</b>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> As before, it was the French who
had the power, the money and the men to force the issue - with England's
welcome support militarily and diplomatically. John Churchill was by this time a Captain in an English regiment of the
French army and would soon become a Colonel. But the development of
his career and his parts in the international conflicts at this time are
described with  little clarity by our author.(in
Chapter Six). The situation in Europe
during the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1670s</b>  appeared to be one of almost continuous flux
as to policy and resolve. A major
problem in its analysis would seem to be the paucity of clear records in the
archives or by means of retained correspondence of the principals
involved. We shall attempt to place the
many events described into some kind of chronology and thus into an assumed
cause and effect sequence. There seems
to have been much 'playing one side against the other' - with its attendant
hypocrisies  as to what was really going
on, who was in charge and what were their objectives.  [The later acquired article on Wikipedia  did clarify the chronology and composition of
the opposing sides in this essentially Franco-Dutch

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Thus, by the end of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1672</b>, king Charles II was still relying
on the shadowy Treaty of Dover with the French. This seems to have provided the English with French subsidies with which
to maintain its weakened armed forces (at home and in France)  including its defeated Navy after Sole Bay -
in exchange for continuing its Declaration of Indulgence by which toleration
of Catholics in England was still allowed. (Both Charles and especially his brother James were suspected of still
being 'Papists' at heart.) Parliament had
been prorogued for over a year and the interest owing on many governments loans
from the moneylenders was not being re-paid. It was thus called back in Feb <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1673</b>
to try to sort matters out - which would require the raising of taxation to
supply the government coffers with more liquidity.  The
first thing it did was demand the rescinding of that Declaration.  For while Parliament was willing to continue
the alliance against the Dutch (Louis's chief concern), <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">it was still the <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">pro-Catholic
inclinations </i>of the Crown </b>that really concerned them<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">. <o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Once the Declaration was removed and a new
Test act passed (by which all those of influence had to swear allegiance to the
Protestant cause), they voted to provide a supply of funds of over a million
pounds. But rumours were still rife that
both Stuart brothers had retained their Catholic leanings. Indeed, James, Duke of
York, finally renounced his various positions (being incompatible with loyalty
to an ostensibly Protestant King) and was replaced by Prince Rupert. However,  the King himself remained under suspicion as
the public became more aware of the real purpose of the Treaty of Dover Moreover, he had sanctioned a marriage
between James  and a Catholic princess -
Mary of Modena thereby ensuring a stronger Catholic position for the monarchy
if and when James became heir to
Charles.  And such large contingents of
the English army under French command made the people increasingly nervous;  they worried that they could eventually be
used to force the  nation towards
Catholicism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> By the autumn of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1673</b>- Churchill was back at the front
in Westphalia serving in the Admiralty Regiment - now with Prince Rupert - but under
the famous French commander Marshall Turenne for the rest of that year. There was apparently a story in which Turenne
described the earlier loss of some minor position defended by an adequate
number of troops which he predicted would soon be re-taken with just half that
number by the 'handsome young English
Captain' and this was indeed punctually accomplished.. While there were no great
operations then planned, Churchill continued to impress and gain further
promotion, despite the removal of the Duke of York, by early<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1674</b>.  It would seem that in their alliance it became
necessary to prevail against certain of the German states (part of 'the Holy
Roman Empire') and their Imperial forces who, with Spain, had decided to ally
with the Dutch to reduce Louis' growing power). as well as against  the Dutch directly. [See article re why
actions were so often centred then on German towns along the Rhine.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> A major campaign was launched on
Holland by Louis in June <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1674 </b> by first besieging the large Dutch fortress
at Maastricht. A delegation of English Officers, including
Monmouth and John Churchill, were involved in the initial attack - on 27 June   and the fortress surrendered on the
30<sup>th</sup>. Louis publically praised
the brave English.  But various new
alliances were making life more difficult for France and by Feb <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1674</b>, the English Parliament decided to
make peace with Holland and her various allies (as noted above).  A suspicious Parliament ,had begun to see the Protestant
Dutch as probably our more natural ally.  The times they were 'a changing' and they
wanted peace with Holland. A new man, Sir Thomas Osborne (soon raised to  Earl of Danby), was gaining power in
Parliament and would become the King's effective Prime Minister in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1674.</b> He was a 'John Bull' character - being fervently for the 'King and
England'  but an Anglican England, not one for either Catholics or
Dissenters. Charles bent with this
prevailing wind (and times) and saw in Danby the strength of character to wield
a strong, <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">supportive</i> Parliament under-pinning his monarchy.  If they
both played their cards right. they could  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">continue</i>
to get money out of both Parliament and the French King   to England's
long-term benefit. !  All very
Machiavellian !<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          It was awkward however to continue an alliance
with France - who would continue paying for English troops stationed there   and yet agree that they would no longer
be available to fight Holland, still France's
main enemy. A compromise was reached
wherein several English regiments there would be reduced in size and
amalgamated;  they would continue providing help to France - but against
her other enemies   on her eastern (German) flank.  And
the French Marshall  (Turenne) wanted
those troops commanded 'by that brilliant young English officer'   John
Churchill - soon to be made a Colonel for that  purpose - which promotion immediately received
 Louis XIV's necessary blessing. This would all transpire in March/April <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1674</b>.
 John still retained his Captain's rank
in respect of his English regiment (still under the Duke of York) but this too
was soon raised    to that of Lieutenant
Colonel, the next year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         The first action of this French-domiciled but English led regiment was the 1<sup>st</sup>
battle of Sinzheim in Oct <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1674</b>   against the  Imperial army  (ie of 'the Holy Roman Empire' - an amorphous
collection of mid-European states). Churchill's role on this earlier occasion was confirmed in two
sources. Firstly, when writing about the
later battle there (2<sup>nd</sup> battle of Sinzheim,   June <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1704</b>)  his Chaplain, a Mr Hare, later Bishop of
Chichester, noted in his  Journal of
those times (when he often accompanied young Churchill) that  the latter battle had brought back memories to
him of that earlier occasion in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1674.</b>  Secondly, Churchill had received a letter dated
even later (16 July <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1711</b>) from a
French widow Madame St Just from Metz. In it, she thanks Churchill profusely  for ordering his troops not to ravage and
destroy her estate at Mezeray (nr Sinzheim) during that earlier battle (as was being done generally in the area by
Marshall Turenne's men   to prevent the
enemy from re-grouping there). [Was John's
decision, Sir Winston wondered,  based on memories about the destruction of an earlier widow's
homestead - at Ashe House   of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1644 </b>?]  Such confirmations seemed
important to our later Winston Churchill in that so many events in those
earlier days do not have reliable provenance in the archive records. Where it does exist, he makes a point of
quoting it - to offset contrary rumours .often quoted by his more critical
opposite numbers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         The evidence of his presence
also at a battle later that same year (late Sept/early Oct) - in Enzheim    is more certainly preserved in a letter
written by John Churchill himself  to the
Duke of Monmouth (illegitimate son of Charles II by Lucy Walter)  then in charge of the overall English contingent. John led his own English battalion (of 3 or 4
regiments), under Monmouth   as part of Turenne's 22,000 man Army   against
double that number of Imperialist troops. Several other English battalions were involved in particular in a very
bloody battle for something called 'the Little Wood' (next to Waldheim)  in which Churchill's  battalion was again much praised by Turenne, although several other regiments were
also recognised.  The letter is quoted in
full and reveals an objective professional post-battle assessment but with some
suggestion that the heavy English losses there (especially of Officers) were suffered
for little or no gain.  But, he was
learning the arts of war from the acknowledged master Turenne which he would
apply successfully in several later battles in the future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  For now, the English contribution to France
was much reduced although the Franco-Dutch war itself would continue until <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1678</b>, without the English. In the meantime, our author Winston provides
us in his Chapter Seven with an interlude that covers <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1675-76</b>   back at the English Court. It will nevertheless have
significance in the on-going life and career
of our hero.  It is  titled simply  '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Thus, during the following 3 years <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1775-77</b>, the wars on the continent
involving France continued, still with some English support, but John Churchill
did not play a part in them.  Evidence as
to why is scarce but it appears that rather than neither Louis or Turenne  requiring his services, it was John himself who
declined any overtures in that regard. It was later in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1675</b> that the
younger sister of Frances Jennings - one <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Sarah
Jennings</b>   was also introduced to the Court. Frances herself had caused quite a stir two
years earlier when she had become a
Lady in Waiting to the Duchess of York She
was a famous beauty who kept herself above the common herd and had no scandal
as a mistress. Her sister Sarah, equally
attractive - a 'precocious, charming figure', was also noteworthy in that moral
respect being very self-possessed and sharp of wit and temper. -Towards the end of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1675</b>, also now attached to the York's household, she began to attend
balls and parties at Court with John
Churchill -, notes Winston Churchill. After one such occasion, --they
fell in love with each other - a love that was to last forever; neither of them henceforward loved anyone else
in their entire lives-. She was just 15
and he 25. He professed his love for her
in countless letters over the next two years - for ever seeking to see her
virtually every day, if at all possible. She remained tantalisingly aloof however  and was no pushover. But they <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">would</i>
marry, eventually.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         The Jenning sisters were born
to Rischard Jennings, Esq, a long serving MP for his home constituency of St
Albans in Hertfordshire  of which county his father in turn had been
High Sheriff  as early as <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1625</b>. The family owned property there and in Kent, as well as  an earlier seat - in Somersetshire   worth in total some &pound;4000 a year. Richard had died before <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1670</b> and his widow, an eccentric character of viiolent temper,
thought of as almost a sorceress, had built up large debts and through the good
offices of the Yorks, had acquired an apartment in the St James palace complex
which apparently gave her legal protection from debt collectors. Amazingly. it was this same <u>family of
Jennings</u> who had once owned the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Manor
of Churchill in Somerset</b> for almost a hundred years (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1540s </b>to<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1640s</b>) - eventually sold because of earlier debts and the Civil
war - to <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Sir John Churchill</b>, the successful
preand post-Civil war London lawyer -
as described above.  It sounds more like
Dickens or Victor Hugo, but it's all true,  not fiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> The earlier Sir Winston Churchill,
our youmg John's father, later expressed the view that had the Jennings  not been forced to sell  that estate  then, he understood that they would have eventually
left it as an inheritance to the new husband to be of their younger daughter \Sarah
- who, unknown then, would in fact eventually become Sarah <u>Churchill</u> ! This scenario is rather awkward to so interpret
(re dates), but see further below.  In
any case, it seems a most odd coincidence in that we must assume that in
meeting Sarah at Court in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1675</b>, John Churchill would have had absolutely no
idea of any such earlier connection with his family's distant past (or his
own).  Before they married, Sarah had two
major disagreements with her troublesome mother and requested that she leave
the palace - being as Sarah believed 'mentally
ill'. This was eventually carried out
after which mother and daughter  got on
much better (as noted in later correspondence). Sarah continued living at St James herself while her sister would soon happily
marry a Lord Hamilton. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         In November <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1676</b>, there were overtures made to lure John back to the
Continental wars (by Louis and his ministers) but when he declined, it was
generally assumed that he was too taken up with courting slightly reluctant Sarah
at that time.  She was growing concerned
at the delay in <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">his</i> proposal of
marriage but as keen as he was, he knew
that his lack of real wealth meant he couldn't afford to set up a proper home
and life for her - just yet.  Moreover,
his father did not support his choice of a wife without proper wealth of her
own.  He had other ideas for him:  There was in particular a girl at Court with a
very wealthy father (not in good health) who would favour his only daughter to
marry John Churchill. She was Catherine Sedley
- not a great beauty but of recognised intelligence and general agreeableness. She had been a mistress of the Duke of York
(along with Arabella and a Lady Ballssis) and was known as once saying in public that she
-knew not what the Duke saw in any of us three; we were all rather plain, and
it couldn't have been our wit, as he wouldn't have understood it !-. Our
author, Sir Winston Churchill, imagines the attitude of his earlier namesake in
seeking to convince his son John to marry Catherine rather than Sarah. He writes three long paragraphs <u>as he
imagines John's father would have more effectively put the case to his son.</u> They are very compelling arguments.  John is clearly between a rock and a hard
place.  Sarah hears about Catherine and
is becoming increasingly annoyed and  cool.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         By the end of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1676</b>, John had broken completely with
Barbara Villiers, much to her chagrin; she went off in a huff - to live in
Paris. But the tensions between him and
Sarah were not of that ilk but rather because his repeated expressions of
undying love for her were never backed up by any reference to exactly <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">when they might reasonably marry</i>. Until then, she remained somewhat aloof and
unresponsive - much to his dismay. John's
father remained a problem; he would not give his agreement to their marriage -
not that this would have any legal standing (although his future inheritance could
well be compromised). By early <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1677</b>, however, John appears to have got
the message from Sarah and began seeking ways to ensure a more secure financial
future   including greater understanding from his patrons - the Yorks - after
which his father came on side as well. In any case, they were finally married in about December <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1677</b> - probably in the apartments of
one of the Royal family at St James - but no trace has been found of a Church
or chapel marriage registration or the
date of same.   There is evidence that they celebrated the
marriage and spent their honeymoon at her former home in Royston, Herts. But, now, where could they afford to  live ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[It
is interesting to note about here that John's uncle Jasper Churchill (3) was
then living not 500 yards away in The Strand  where he was himself apparently 'rolling in
money'   at least as owed him from the many monetary advances he had made to
the gentry and aristocracy during the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1670</b>s.
He died in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1678</b> and presumably his
wife Frances became rather well off. Meanwhile John and Sarah were still counting
their pennies !]<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         While John's situation had  improved, he was himself still not that well
off and his father's estate was of less value than formerly. Nevertheless, he and his wife were happy to
provide accommodation for the newly-weds at their new Dorset home at Minterne Magna
when they were not still living in John's bachelor apartments on Jermyn Street,
just of St James in London. Otherwise
they were often away on his duties living in temporary married quarters with
the Duke of York and/or the Regiment.  It
would be 5 years before he could afford to provide his wife and family with
their own home (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1682</b>). [So much for the rumours that Barbara,
Duchess of Cleveland, had given him
untold funds.] During his 3 years away
from military action (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1775-78</b>), John
did at least gain in diplomatic experience at which his exceptional skills were
becoming recognised and to match those on the field. Once married, he continued in this sphere as
needed - always with  \Sarah's  complete support. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   In
the political arena, Danby had reached the peak of his influence in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1678</b>.  Importantly, he had arranged the marriage
between Holland's William of Orange and Mary, the elder daughter of the Duke of York, just the year before.
This Protestant union was yet one more nail in the coffin of any continued alliance
with Catholic France.  The gradual
alliance with Holland of Prussia, Spain and the (Holy Roman) Empire, soon
extended to include England as well, finally placed France in a vulnerable
position. For a time, Charles sought
further subsidies from them to 'stay on side', but the writing was effectively
on the wall. Parliament was finally ready
to sever the French connection completely and had they done so in a more timely
fashion, progress would likely have been quicker and more  efficient. As it was, the times favoured John
Churchill in both his diplomatic and military options, in any case.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  The English army was increased to 30,000 men
and on Feb 18 <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1678</b>, John was promoted to the rank of Colonel in a
new regiment of Foot. He and Sarah were  still  residing in Minterne at the time when John was
summoned by the Duke to London.  {It is
interesting to recall that at that same time, the Churchills of Dorchester were enjoying the
quiet life of Dorset country Squires at
Muston.] John wrote back to Sarah
shortly after saying that the Duke wanted him to go to Holland to lead
negotiations in regard to the balance of forces from Holland, Spain and England
against France, if required. Decisions had to be made in respect of 4 English battalions still stationed in Bruges
as well. John's friend Sidney Godolphin
had been sent to deal with political matters arising. John was to promise
20,000 troops with guns to William. Trust
was thus being given to two young men of recognised merit of the next generation
and important new relationships were being forged with William of Orange and with England's future political
direction.  Although the Duke and his half
brother Monmouth were still of a pro-Catholic disposition, they finally
switched sides (as Charles had wanted for some time) - to support Protestant
Holland by the end of April <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1678</b>   fearing
France's continued attempt at Catholic domination in Europe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> On May 1<sup>st</sup> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1678</b>, John Churchill was appointed a
Brigadier of Foot, with powers to recruit men to fill the several Infantry Regiments
of two  new  Battalions   thus constituting a full Brigade.  By June, he was ready to proceed
to Flanders   to oppose the French there and his orders arrived to that effect
on Sept 5<sup>th</sup> that year; he was to accompany another new Brigadier, Sir John Fenwick, with his equivalent forces. After Monmouth
had also joined William of Orange's attack of a week earlier, with another 8000
English troops, Charles II sought to determine if Louis was ready yet to sue for Peace.  A kind of stalemate ensued and during the next
three years (late <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1679 </b>to<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> 1682</b>), John and Sarah had to lead a precarious,
non-military existence as diplomatic go-betweens their patrons (the Duke and
Duchess of York) and the two significant
monarchs of the age - Charles II and Louis XIV, and their Ministers. The British public and their Parliament would
no longer accept the Duke's increasing Catholicism (especially as he would
normally become their next monarch) - so he was first exiled to Belgium and
later to Scotland. John Churchill and
wife were themselves 100% Anglicans but the Duke would trust no one else as
much to try to negotiate his situation with all and sundry over those difficult
years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Our modern day Churchill then
quotes about a dozen letters between John and Sarah which reflect these awkward
times for them.  On about 24 Oct <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1679</b>,
Sarah gave birth to their first child - a daughter   Harriet Churchill. At that time, John was on his way to Scotland
by coach to attend the Duke. Because of the ill feelings towards the latter,
John expresses the need to keep moving on as he does not find it safe wherever
he stays overnight (as at Doncaster or Berwick, say). He is in Edinburgh by mid-December and writes
that if he is required to remain there, he prays that Sarah will come to join
him immediately.  However, by the end of
January, King Charles had sent word that James and family could finally return from
exile to London. Churchill accompanied them, leaving at the end of February by sea-going yacht. He was not very well then, suffering from the
severe headaches and seizures that he
had had periodically since childhood. Nor was his young daughter Harriet well back home    whom he hoped would soon be over her
'red spots'. He arrived  home (in Jermyn Street) by early March  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1680</b> - just in time to see her before she sadly died in her  infancy - just 4 months old. No
anti-biotics then. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          During <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1680</b>
and <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">'81</b>,  John Churchill continued to serve the Duke of
York as best he could despite the latter's continued obstinacy in adhering to the Catholic faith (secretly) -
whether back in Scotland or in London. In
either case, the combined religious and political forces in the country kept
the Duke increasingly suspect and liable to exile. Finally, at the end of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1682</b>, Churchill was rewarded by the King with something called 'the
Barony of Churchill in Aymouth   a title within the Peerage of Scotland. Whether this entailed any financial benefit
or not is not mentioned.  In the meantime, the careers of two  future queens - sisters Mary and Anne - enter  the scene from about this period on.. They
had,  of course, always been around - as
young girls at Court - the latter quite reliant on her best friend, a slightly
older Sarah Jennings - later Churchill. And,
as noted, her elder sister Mary would eventually marry William of Orange and so
further ensure a Protestant  continuity and
influence for the future Crown. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          But their stories must take a back seat
through the early years of this period - ca <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1680-83</b>   when Lord Shaftesbury and a Whig Parliament replaced
Danby and the Tories. Anyone now suspected
of promoting the Catholic cause was liable to be imprisoned and executed -
often on slim evidence. This included even
Charles' queen - Catherine   and still his brother James, even more than
before. Shjaftesbury seemed to be a kind
of Vicar of Bray character, having previously supported the Treaty of Dover
with France, the Declaration of Indulgence and those millions (of francs) from France   when it suited him.  Bu, increasingly,  no  longer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Against the background of this new political
conflict - between two opposing factions which would soon coalesce into the
Liberal and Conservative parties in Britain for the next 300 years - King Charles
II managed to take a relatively neutral stance but did act decisively on one
important occasion and come out surprisingly unscathed. The conflicts were fought out at all levels
of society - in law Courts, in State trials, in assassination Plots and in
Parliament - everywhere except on the battlefield, although that too was a
close run thing.   It was a <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">kind of</i> civil war, says Churchill, whose
outcome would effectively determine the left-right political system not only of
Britain but of countless other nations
in the future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Churchill describes the events of
this 3 year period vividly in 4 long paragraphs that would be very difficult to
summarise except in 4 even longer paragraphs. Suffice to say that after the former Cromwellians had voiced their
growing anger at the dissolute life style of the rich generally and the Court
of the monarch in particular - with an increasing belief that such as the Great Fire and the Plague were God's
punishments for their wickedness  and,
after three Elections with everyone at
each other throats, the King suddenly decided to dissolve Parliament in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1680</b>.  He re-convened them in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1681</b>   but at Oxford - to avoid the typically riotous crowds of
London. But that new Whig Parliament set
to with even more determination   to exclude Catholic-tainted James from
succeeding Charles.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Shaftesbury then presented an ultimatum
to Charles requiring him to name his illegitimate (and now Protestant) son
Monmouth to succeed rather than his Catholic-leaning
brother James.  Charles refused and
dissolved Parliament again and retired to Windsor castle for his own
protection. Some politicians wanted a Republic, and a Plot was hatched to
assassinate both royal brothers; others had already been executed - often
unfairly.  But, amazingly, by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1682</b>, the mood of the general public began
to turn - as though the anti-Catholic
feeling had finally burnt itself out - at least, for now.  Too much innocent blood had been shed already.
 The King decided to prosecute
Shaftesbury for high treason - but only after replacing many of the latter's Whig place men in the Courts and
Sheriffs' offices in rabid London. Shaftesbury fled to protestant Holland but soon died there in exile.  Other chief Whigs and plotters were turned
against and revengeful executions ensued. The times were indeed very difficult.                     <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         By <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1683</b>, the King was thus once again safe on his English throne and,
moreover, had ensured the hereditary principle of primogeniture - with the
Crown still due to accede to his brother James.  Charles  was effectively still in the pay of the French
King but the latter no longer had any local political or military influence in
England  The next three years (<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1683-85</b>) were thus ones of
relative peace and so John Churchill's
role vis a vis his patron James, Duke of York could proceed again on a less troubled
basis.  His life at Court could resume
and, in fact, he became a frequent companion of the monarch himself - often
playing tennis with him and with other fellow courtiers. He was promoted to the post of Colonel of the
King's Own Dragoons with an increase in salary.  As a result, he and Sarah were finally able to
purchase their own house in the country - on the edge of  St Albans  not far from where Sarah grew up. [Shirley and I often shopped in its weekly
street market there when we lived in nearby Hertford town in about <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1965/66 - </b>almost 300 years later.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  The Jennings sisters Frances and Sarah had
inherited a small Manor  called Sandridge
 situated on one side of St Albans - as
well as an old house and a few acres   called Holywell House   on the other
side of town, near the bridge over the small river Ver.  John bought out Frances' share of the
latter in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1681</b> and by <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1684</b>, he and
Sarah had the old house pulled down and a new one built nearby  on its land. With Sarah, John Churchill would live there for the rest their lives. In many letters home, he expressed his longing to, return there with affection.
He never resided at the famous Blenheim Palace to be built for him later by a
grateful nation. His St Albans house was itself eventually pulled down in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1827</b> and sadly no trace of it remains
today. Their eldest daughter Harriet died quite young there but they bad two more girls - Henrietta in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1681</b> and Anne in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1684</b> who both thrived and were raised at St Albans. There were no sons
as yet and the future of this impressive line of Churchills  seemed unlikely and may have to proceed via issue of his eventually married daughters
when teir issue's surnames would gradually be altered to reflect the more
famous one. Our author Winston Spencer_Churchill would descend from a cousin
line from this source.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> While John and Sarah were content
to live their future lives at Holywell House in the country (rather than near Whitehall
or the Palace in London, with its  increasingly
fraught Court of intrigue and complexity). John was content to ride into London only when his positions
required it, but  a  role there
for Sarah  seemed more difficult to
avoid.  Her childhood friend the Princess
Anne, now into adulthood, had a continual need of her. And, as our author Sir Winston remarks -Anne (and
her times) will soon become the central fulcrum of our tale-. To Anne, Sarah represented all that she
wanted in an affectionate close friend and insisted there be no difference in
rank expressed between them - especially on a private, personal level. And John
too would gradually assume a more protective role in regard to Anne himself than
would normally be the case - as the reigns first of Charles II and then of his
brother James II came to their respective closes.  He and Sarah, with their close friend
Godolphin and the two royal sisters Mary and Anne thus formed a tight bond and,
with others of like mind. frequently met together secretly in  private rooms in the Palace - ones they
jointly agreed to call  '<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">the Cockpit'</i>. With the succession and the religious,
military and political situations all growing more complex, important decisions
made there would prove decisive in both John Churchill's, and in the nation's,  successful future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Charles II died early on  Jan 27 <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1685</b>
from an unexpected stroke suffered during the  night. His brother James, the Duke, had long anticipated and prepared for this
event and his own accession to the Crown. He had been cultivating a much less obvious expression  of his under-lying
Catholicism over the preceding 2 years. He met with the necessary Privy Council within 15 minutes of Charles middle
of the night passing and proclaimed to them his total willingness to rule the
country '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><u>according to its democratic laws
and established religion'</u></b>. He
would keep his own faith privately to himself and family, <u>he promised</u>. The public appeared quite ready for this
succession - in this traditional way   especially as the Tories were now in power
and were essentially a pro-Anglican, anti-Dissident (Puritan) party, that were
relatively tolerant of the few Catholics - of the 'old religion'.  This contrasted with the Whigs who were much
more anti-Catholic but pro-Dissident (as Methodism) , and not so pro-Anglican
(of the 'establishment'. Their hope for
the future monarchy had laid in the direction of the (protestant) Duke of
Monmouth - Charles' eldest but illegitimate son then in exile in Protestant
Holland (along with Scotland's like-minded Lord Argyll).  But, they were not then in power   but ever
hopeful to return to same and thet'd even contemplated attempting a coup
believing that back home, there were many of their persuasion. And Holland's  monarch William would happily lead them if
this came to pass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> An election was soon called and
the new Parliament were still solidly Tory and quite happy with the new King James
and his public Proclamation (tkat ptomise) . This was still in early <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1685</b>. But, notes our author, -Events were at hand which
would impel James to cast aside his intended and proclaimed restraints.-  These pro-Catholic 'events' (clarified later) weren't
quite 'at hand' just yet, however, for an earlier event of some consequence
would  first intervene   and bring John Churchill firmly back
into our story. For Monmouth did quite quickly decide to 'invade', along with Argyll. They each raised small armies and, with three
ships each, made their respective ways back to England and Scotland (from
Holland). In very windy conditions,
Monmouth's  ships were tossed hither and
thither in the English channel for over two weeks and, quite coincidentally,
finally made port <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">at Lyme Regis</i> in
Dorset  - apparently arbitrarily - on
June 11<sup>th</sup> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1685</b>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> But, the local MP there then was of
course none other than John's father   Sir Winston Churchill ! He had recently shifted his constituency from
Weymouth to there and of course immediately that he received news of this
'rebellious imvasion'   centred on his constituency    sent messages to his son John, to the
government and to the Palace - by June 13<sup>th</sup>. This would give John further scope to display
his loyalty (for now) to the new King and likely to increase the merit of his
reputation as a successful leader - now of Btigade strength  or larger  Any battles, in June and July <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1685</b>), would thus take place in country
he knew from his youth - in Somerset, Devon  and Dorset.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          Monmouth would rely on gathering support as
he moved inland - from natural Whig
supporters and various Dissident Protestant groups with considerable  anti-Tory, anti-Catholic, anti-Establishment
sympathies of that rural west-country population (mostly farm labourers and
small traders). But he had little time
to train them.  He proclaimed to the
public that James had in fact murdered his own father Charles, and that he (Monmouth)
was himself actually born <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">in wedlock</i>,
etc, etc.  One could sum up the ensuing
conflict as it quickly ran its course within the rather limited scope of these
adjoining English counties, without its considerable detail, but it might
be useful firstly to at least quote more
fully some of our author's rich prose regarding the circumstances leading up to
this affair - generally referred to as 'Monmouth's Rebellion'. He describes it all with a certain relish !<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          He takes up his description from the point
when John Churchill's father (and his own namesake, Sir Winston Churchill) learns
(in London) of the surprise arrival of Monmouth in Lyme Regis, his very
constituency. -He took the messengers just arrived from that west country town directly
to the Palace himself and, summoning his son John, they were immediately conducted
to the King. This must have been a great
day for old Sir Winston, one in which all the harmonies of his life seemed
happily finally to merge. Here was the
(new) King for whose sacred rights and royal line he had himself fought with
sword and pen (in the <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1640</b>s), for
whom he had suffered so much, and  had also
done him the honour - no mere formality - of making him (when still the Duke)  four times a grandfather (via Arabella), now once
more assaulted by rebellion. The same obstinate, traitorous forces - happily
without votes - were again rampant in those same familiar west-country scenes
in which he had lived his early life. The old cause was once more at stake, and in the old place. And here now
stood his own son, now Colonel of the Dragoons, the rising soldier of the day,
high in the favour of the threatened monarch, long linked to his very service,
who would march forward at the head of the Household Troops - the 'corps
d'elite,   <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">to lay the insolent usurper
low</i> ! It was Sir Winston's
apotheosis.  There must have been a
strong feeling of the continuity of history in this small group, which <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">this prophetic coincidence</i>  had so brought together !-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  That very night John Churchill, raised to the
rank of Brigadier-General,  set out with his Troops and with a Colonel and
his Regiment. Monmouth could not have
made his move at a worse moment (for his
own designs). The Tory Parliament was
still in session. An act of Attainder
against Monmouth was immediately passed and a price of &pound;5000 placed on his head (about &pound;400,000 today) . The King was at his most popular and both
Houses voted all necessary supplies (of money) and assured the King they were
ready to die in his defence. Other
troops still in Holland were sent home - with William of Orange's approval at
this stage (which he saw however as too soon for success); he'd bide his own time). He had indeed tried to dissuade Monmouth from
making his attempt just yet (and no doubt hoped to get the call from England <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">himself</i> (a fellow Protestant) - but
rather later - to proceed against James and Catholicism (including in Ireland).
 <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">           John Churchill reached Bridport in Dorset on
June 17<sup>th</sup> and found the
situation worse than feared. While the nobility and gentry were still 'for the
King', the people generally (Dissident country-folk and tradesmen) were for
Monmouth and Non-Anglican Protestantism. Even the county militias, if poorly trained, and initially for the King
soon deserted that cause and joined the rebels. Churchill wrote to the King from Bridport pointing all this out and indicated
that he would need some of the King's other regular forces - to better
encourage those he did have. Monmouth
had entered Taunton in Somerset on the 18<sup>th</sup> (finding some loyalty
there) and Churchill and his men soon moved inland in that direction.  On the way, he received messages from
Monmouth (at Chard) asking him to remember their old friendship and begging his
aid now. John, carefully weighing his
own 'long term' position, wisely sent the message back to the King saying 'he of
course declined the invitation'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          But, in the meantime, the King's council had
time to weigh up the situation themselves and while content with Churchill's
known military abilities, had some slight reservations in placing him in
overall command because of his background in the local area of concern (the
west country)  known for its Protestant and Dissenting sympathies. The former Duke of York knew too of his underlying
anti-Catholic and pro-Protestant views - if still a fervent Royalist who (at
this stage) over-looked James' underlying if dormant Catholicism). So he
placed a renown French-descended leader   M. Feversham    in command, as a precaution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> While accepting this, despite
expressing his view that he (John) was more than capable in dealing with
Monmouth forthwith, he decided it was politic to obey Feversham to the letter,
but no doubt grew further suspicious of James' longer term motivations.
Meanwhile, Monmouth was having difficulty in gaining the overwhelming support
he had vainly hoped for (as at Bristol which Feversham had reached a day
earlier) and, after a small skirmish
near Bath with the latter, had
eventually to face the English troops just north of Taunton led by  both Churchill and a late-arriving Feversham. The
key battle took place on July 5<sup>th</sup> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1685</b>   on the fields of Sedgemoor, near the village of Weston
Zayland in Somerset.  A night attack was
planned and executed by Monmouth but, by dawn, the growing light soon revealed
his hopeless position. He attempted to
escape but was later found in a ditch, cold and hungry, and soon taken prisoner
to London. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         While Feversham partied in
Taunton revelling in sight of his captured enemy, Churchill quietly slipped
home to Sarah and was later lauded by his own men who spoke disparagingly of
Feversham at Court who, nevertheless was subsequently honoured by James as the seeming
hero (which outcome and attendant praise Churchill had fully predicted). But rather than make any obvious moves to
seek any recognition himself (as based on those general comments by all the
other Officers at Court) Churchill wisely kept his  cards close to his chest and wouldn't reveal
his true growing feelings regarding James' expected treachery (to renege on his
Proclamation). He said all the right
things, for now, and bided his time.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         Soon after the defeat of
Monmouth in mid-<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1685</b>, James grew increasingly
confident in his position. Both
Parliament and the Army, as well as the public generally, were expressing their
increasing loyalty to him; he was displaying a  growing sense of his
royal power (long anticipated) and, as a consequence, began following a path more in tune with his heart than his
head. (The 'events' referred to by
Churchill.)  His tacit purpose thus
became one of veering England, ever so gradually,
towards a Catholic future and himself as an absolute monarch - a la Louis
XVI.   However,  he realised that his accession promises would have
to be diluted - if again only gradually. He would slowly place his true Catholic confidantes into positions of
power or influence   whether as
Ministers, members of Parliament, Judges in the Courts, or Officers in the
Army. The Whig's Test Act and Habeas
Corpus would have to be over-turned. <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">'His' </i>Army would be greatly increased
and those (often Irish) Catholics recruited to help in the recent attempted rebellion
would now be retained - but  as Officers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         He began increasingly to
display the same obstinacy in not abandoning a belief in the divine right of
Kings - effectively to rule dictatorially, as shown by his naively rigid grandfather
Charles 1<sup>   </sup>50 years earlier. While the country and Parliament in its Protestant Tory orientation were
fairly tolerant of these initial pro-Catholic adjustments during <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1685-86</b>, this direction of change (even
seeking to bring the Dissenters into a coalition with the Catholics against the
established Anglican church and the Tory establishment) was ultimately opposed
by the Protestant majority. It has been estimated that less than one family in
400 were true Catholics at that time;  that is, but a quarter of 1% !  And even some
of them were concerned that the King was obviously trying to alter the
prevailing faith of the country - so going against his own Proclamation to the
contrary. Not a wise move. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">          By the autumn of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1687</b>, things were getting out of hand and by April <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1688</b>, they had become progressively worse .and several senior
politicians, headed by Danby, decided to act outside Parliament and secretly invite
William of Orange to be ready to invade. He had married James' elder daughter
Mary (conveniently brought up a Protestant) and together they could rightfully claim
and share the Crown of Britain   if James did not keep to his proclaimed promises
of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1685</b>.  The two chief Ministers of the cabinet (Sunderland
and Jeffery) finally sought to convince James, in about June <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1688</b>, to rescind all ,his pro-Catholic
orders or that invitation (of which he would likely now be aware would be
proceeded with and implemented forthwith).     <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">            John Churchill had remained loyal to
the King almost to the last but had frequently to remind James that this was with
<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">the unyielding proviso</i> that his own
Protestant faith and belief in democracy for his country would in any final
analysis <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"><u>always</u></i></b> take precedence. And so it did. That precedence
was finally expressed secretly in writing to William by Aug <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1688</b>   although he continued to express
loyalty (to the King's person) for the next three months to the extent that
James might yet be persuaded to relent in his almost suicidal determination to
turn the nation Catholic.  Thus, on Aug 4
<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1688</b>, John wrote a letter to William
in Holland committing his service entirely to him to insure the continuation of
their shared Protestant faith in a democratic United Kingdom.  By October that year, William was indeed readying
his army and navy to come to the aid of the Kingdom to this end as, by then,
that Protestant status  strongly appeared
still to be purposely opposed by James; a critical point had, in many minds, indeed
been finally reached. Several Ministers
and ex-Ministers then sought William's intervention more explicitly forthwith. Sunderland,
who had played both sides against the middle seemingly, turned out to be in
most minds already plotting against James (secretly) for some months past while
only appearing to be loyal. He was not
alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  William's ships and troops then sailed on Oct
19th and, after powerful north-easterly winds forced him further west than
wanted, he finally landed at Torbay, Devon  on  November  5<sup>th</sup> that year. On learning this, James
then mis-calculated in thinking that William would not attract many supporters
in that Whig'ish, Dissenting 'far west-country'. He was wrong. William's ship had flown the English flag
embroidered with his motto: -I will maintain the Protestant religion and the
Liberties of England-. This simple message basically 'said it all'. After landing, he organised his men (from
many Protestant nations) in Exeter before starting out for London. James had arranged for his own large army (of
uncertain loyalty) to proceed to Salisbury about where, if William advanced from
Exeter, they would likely meet.  At the
very last moment, James had apparently relented on many of the demands made
earlier by Sunderland - except for re-calling Parliament, saying he couldn't do
so with an invading power in the land. But this rather weak response was in any case now too late. William was on his way and the nation had had
enough of James' continual vacillations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         Once landed and marching towards
the heart of England, William's army received word of James having ordered his
army, now led by his trusted Feversham, to the Salisbury area in mid-south England.
 On 7 November, to ensure as much as
possible the loyalty of his mainly English army, especially its Officers, James
promoted John Churchill (still holding his cards very close to his chest) to the
rank of  Brigadier heading a full
division - but still under Feversham. By
this point, Churchill was definitely not looking for any leadership role, even
overall command, if it implied he was to pursue the King's underlying goal of a
Catholic England. Nevertheless, he still played along as though he would be
opposing the advancing William (as an invader) - in the unlikely event that James
did relent in his Catholic, authoritarian fixation (at the last minute).  Possibly John hadn't'yet heard the aphorism
pertaining to the Jesuits: -Give me the
boy to 7, and I will show you the man-.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Otherwise, he was apparently about to reveal his desertion (based on his
consistently expressed views) as he and the King marched together   from
Windsor towards Salisbury - where he would leave him a letter explaining his <u>finally
revealed decision</u> - to be delivered just after he and his men had in the
night suddenly taken a more decisive southwest route.  This was so triggered after he had  received news privately that an Officer in the Dragoon Guards  (Lord Conbury, eldest son of Lord Clarendon) had
arrived at the Salisbury field a few hours before  Churchill or the King   Some of the army were already there and, being
the most senior Officer there,  he was thus
in sole command for about critical 4 hours. He quickly announced to  the  junior Officers that 'he had Orders for an
immediate raid on one of William's advanced attachments'.  <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">This was
a total deception</i>. He thus took 3
Regiments of Horse and marched them directly towards Axminster and thence to Honiton,
Devon (ie westward) - not <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">to confront</i> William but to <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>meet up with</u></i> his army - to <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">join</i> them (and Churchill) - and thus to
now <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">oppose</i> James. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  Cornbury's desertion (seemingly part of the
plot hatched earlier with, amongst other, Churchill) was thus the first of many
desertions to follow (although the mood overall was still on a knife-edge as to
who would and who wouldn't desert). Many
young Officers in James' army simply wanted to be on the winning side, whoever
it was, for their own later advancement.  Churchill had hoped that if the tide of
support appeared to be edging away from James (who still had the larger army),
most of the men would come over to William, now with Churchill clearly on board
as well. It was a very risky strategy -
still of uncertain outcome.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> The foregoing was decided upon as
a way to avoid an all-out conflict and deaths that could instead be settled by
negotiation - if most of the men could see the likelihood of William gaining so
much support that James was bound to lose.  Various elements of the audacious desertion of
Lord Cornbury and his men (from supporting James) , including the fact that,
critically, he had somehow been left in sole command before James and Churchill
and other senior Officers had arrived at Salisbury, that he and others
including Churchill had often met in October (at the Cockpit) to discuss matters
of the succession (Cornbury being a cousin of Princess Anne   William's sister
in law) all pointed to this pre-arranged Plot  to encourage James to negotiate a peace rather
than engage with his now apparently growing enemy - with so many likely casualties.
 Indeed, Anne had written a letter to
William some uncertain time before November 18 (when it was so dated and sent
from the Cockpit) assuring him that -...he
had all her good wishes for success and that her husband Prince George (of
Denmark) <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">would</i> be joining him - despite
having ridden with the King just the day before (17<sup>th</sup>) from Windsor  towards Salisbury   crucially
intending however  (as with
Churchill) to proceed forthwith to join <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">your</i> forces.- It transpired that very many of the nobility in
crucial positions throughout the country had also already agreed to oppose James. He and Feversham were simply the last to know
of this growing nation-wide opposition.  In
one sense, it was an enormous risk to
their respective lives and futures.  After all, James had  brought together the largest single army under
an English flag that the nation had yet seen.  It would all hinge on <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal">their</i> uncertain loyalty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">    A Council of War was held by James and his
top commanders on the evening of November 23 - probably as they marched from Windsor
south-westward towards Salisbury.  When
asked their opinion in regard to the first move to be made against the enemy,
Churchill and Grafton (then still with him) advised that they continue to advance
toward them (to the west). while the top two French commanders thought it wiser
to retreat eastwards once nearer Salisbury .- possibly to draw William towards
London and into some less favourable fighting ;position. Churchill's motivation regarding the advice he
proffered has been much analysed  but our
author suggests it was likely designed to draw James further <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">away</i> from London so that Sarah and
others could more safely convey Princess Anne (and themselves) from the capitol
<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">towards the north</i>   where other
aristocrats in on the plans (as the Duke of Devonshire in particular) could provide them with safe haven  in such as Nottingham and Derby. Moreover, it
would allow John Churchill to make easier contact with William when, at the
last minute, he decided to join him. This
decision took effect shortly after they arrived at their positions near
Salisbury around midnight of the 23<sup>rd</sup>. He, Grafton and Berkeley with 400 Officers
and Troopers quietly re-mounted their horses and, as others slept,  rode off towards Crewkerne, 50 miles <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">south-west</i>, being quite close to William
and his forces, now at Axminster (as alluded to above) . By then,  it was the morning of Nov 24<sup>th</sup>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> It was at this pre-planned time
that Churchill left behind him his crucial letter for the King. It read, essentially:  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Sir,         Despite the fact that I could have no
better advantage in life than to continue in your service, and accept that in
your present position, you deserve the strictest obedience from all your
subjects, especially from one with the greatest personal obligation to your
majesty, I am nevertheless actuated by a higher principle and by the inviolable
dictates of my conscience <u>in respect of my religion</u> and must therefore
desert you at this time-but will ever seek to ,protect your royal person and
lawful rights-'   <o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">                       Churchill. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">            One of his allies in this endeavour, Prince
George  (Princess Anne's husband), wrote
in similar vein from Denmark stressing that he -could not in conscience but
support all the other Princes in Europe against <u>the enemies of the
Protestant church</u>, as backed by the zeal and cruelty of the prevailing Catholic power of France, by
seeking the reinforcement of the democratic laws of that government (in
England) on which alone both the well  being
of your majesty and <u>the future of the Protestant religion</u> in Europe
depend.-   It appears that Churchill not only denied
further support for his patron and monarch (finally) but had organised unspoken
support for what was essentially a
rebellion in all the crucial centres of power in the country   whether
military or otherwise - at its simplest being  <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"><u>for</u>
Protestantism and <u>against</u> Catholicism </b>(with their implications for Democracy)<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">. </b>  That
was the absolute crux of the matter - no 'ifs' and no 'buts'. It wasn't a
political or an economic conflict, but one <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal"><u>of
religion</u></i><u> <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">and decision-making</i></u><i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">.</i>  '<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">Who

Catholic King or othe  people - through a democratically elected

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   Thus, in
the north, the Duke of Devonshire (centred on Derbyshire) raised 5000 men on
horse locally. He  would be involved in greeting the arrival of
Princess Anne at nearby Nottingham - having been accompanied there by
Churchill's wife Sarah who oversaw her safe departure from London on that key
date of Nov 24<sup>th</sup> (that fateful day) before James could return and
possibly hold certain relatives as a kind of guarantee for, his own safety. But
they weren't there. It was suggested by
Churchill, the author, that it was this reversal of loyalty that had motivated
some later writers to withhold support for his otherwise laudable exploits for
the nation. It just wasn't cricket. Some people feel that certain principles
are inviolable - as though pragmatism is <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:normal">always</i>
inferior to blindly adhered to 'principle' - often taken on board in youth -
without analysis; Just on faith.  Context is everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> James' large professional army
had very quickly lost heart and many had indeed deserted to William's side
before any significant actions had transpired between them. The king  soon returned  to London once he realised his support was
fast ebbing away and so assembled any Privy Councillors still in London for their
advice. They advised him to enter into
negotiations with William immediately and agree an amnesty for all those who
supported him. James concurred while still
intending (as became apparent later) not to properly cooperate   in order to
gain time to arrange an escape to France - firstly for his wife and son, and for himself very shortly after. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         It was now about Dec 1<sup>st</sup>
and William was in no hurry to deal with James's negotiating Ministers, even
though he knew they were basically all on his own side. He didn't want any suggestions to arise that
he, as a foreigner with some foreign troops, had actually invaded  England   to
overthrow its Catholic-minded monarch - who had properly succeeded to the
throne <u>but,</u> with his Proclamation. He was simply the husband of James' elder daughter Mary who was
effectively replacing her father who had persistently refused to obey <u>the
laws of England</u> (and his own Proclamation) - <u>to lead a Protestant
country</u>. She and William would
willingly so lead the country and effect same after a<i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"> bloodless</i> rebellion   overseen by Churchill. William would prefer not to have to negotiate
anything. By Dec 9<sup>th</sup>, James
had finally successfully re-arranged the departure of his wife and son (an
earlier attempt was refused by the Official ordered to arrange it   on the
grounds that it would be seen as treason according to current English
law).  At about 2 am on  Dec 11<sup>th,</sup>, James sought to follow
them.  There had been no
negotiations. One could start with a
tabula rasa. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  James first sought to cause as much confusion
as possible by deceiving the Council as to his intentions, by throwing the
Great Seal into Thames,, by ordering Feversham to disband the army without pay,
and his chief Admiral to sail his ships to Ireland  (he  surrendered
them to William instead). The unpaid,
mostly Irish soldiers ran riot amid rumours of their danger to the non-Catholic
population. James then crossed the river and rode as fast as possible for the
coast and a ship.  Just what his status
in law would be if he succeeded in leaving was uncertain. Had he abdicated, deserted or surrendered  ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> By Dec 14<sup>th</sup>, the Council in London had  re-gained the initiative, subdued the riotous chaos
there and <u>voted to acknowledge William's authority</u>. He was asked to hasten to London. The very next day, a countryman from Kent
arrived at the Council, then sitting, to report that he was conveying 'a
message from the King'. He had found a
ship and boarded her but had missed the tide. He was mistaken for an escaping
Jesuit priest and soon set upon roughly by the fishermen and townspeople. To
restore some decorum, the Council authorised James's 'Gentleman of the
Bedchamber', one Ailesbury, to retrieve him personally from Sheerness
(accompanied by various of his Household staff). Once back in London (by about Dec 19<sup>th</sup>)
, William immediately arranged for him to be taken a short way <u>back down  river</u>   to the port of Rochester in
Kent. He also promoted rumours that
James' life there was in danger   as though encouraging a second escape attempt
- as his return was most inconvenient politically. William then arranged that a back door where
he was held be left unguarded and some departing ships conveniently
available. This time, James finally succeeded
(about Dec 21st) in leaving English soil for ever. William received the good news by Dec 23rd 1688.  In
one important sense, the country was 'free at last' ! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         While in normal circumstances,
James' son would be expected to succeed his father, this would be made null and
void once the latter's refusal to adhere  to his Proclamation became obvious and William
and Mary were asked to assume the Crown jointly and maintain the established
Protestant church of England. They were consequently
crowned as such in April 1689. James would
remained in exile but seek to control
events (as in Ireland) from abroad. Much had to await the debating in
Parliament of the many unprecedented aspects arising from this never-before-experienced
situation.  So many questions were raised.
 Exactly when and why did Great Britain
no longer have a Monarch ? Did James  abdicate or desert ? Should his dis-enfranchisement  be effected by Act of Parliament ? And what about his son; was he still his legal  heir ? Should William reign on his own ? If Mary dies, who succeeds her (or William)
? Would it be Mary's sister Anne, or her
new brother ?  Much of all this was
addressed by Parliament over the following 3 months of <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal">1689</b>.  In the end, it was
decided that William and Mary should reign jointly and on the latter's death,
that William should continue for his life, and then Anne should succeed.  Again, John Churchill kept a low profile other
that swearing his allegiance as described. As things developed, however, his role would necessarily become more central and relied upon.  Amazingly, his greatest achievements were
still to come - when serving William and Mary, and later Anne, over coming
decades. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         During the first 3 months of 1690,
negotiations of all kinds continued apace - involving the potential Crown, the
Parliament and the Church. William would
have preferred to rule as sole monarch but eventually accepted with good grace
that he should only do so jointly with his wife Mary. In the event of her death before him,
Parliament agreed that he would then rule as sole Monarch until his own death and that Mary's sister
Anne would then assume the Crown, with her husband Prince George as
Consort. He realised that John Churchill
and wife Sarah held significant influence over Anne and made a point of
declaring that they would not so 'govern' him and Mary. However, because his main motivation was in
overcoming the power of France in Europe, William soon made John Lieutenant
General and thus practically Commander-in-Chief of the entire English Army. But, just as James had his French Feversham,
so William had his Dutch Schomberg - with his advice   as an intermediary
between Churchill and the new King. Churchill
had assumed a moderate middle course in all the prior negotiations and, as
always, was happy to play the ';long game'   of strategy, not tactics. It paid
off. In April at the Coronation, he was
created  'Earl - of Marlborough'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin_left:0cm"><span style="font_size:12.0pt;
line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">         We may recall that the sister of
John's grandmother Lady Eleanor Drake had married one James Ley, 1st Earl of
Marlborough. By<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:
normal"> 1665</b>, the then 3<sup>rd</sup> Earl of that title died (without
heirs)  in a sea battle against the Dutch. The title  had become dormant  and, having his choice of name for this
honour, John chose it. Almost
immediately after, in May <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1690</b>, war
was formerly declared against France. Marlborough (as he was now called) would lead an army of 8000 men, as
the English contingent, against the French in Flanders. Four armies in total
would be involved initially - those of the English, the Dutch , the Spanish and
the Swedes.  The Germans and the Empire
force would soon join in. An effective world
conflict had thus begun. on the continent and would reach its full intensity only gradually. Various sides would
alter their allegiances as it suited their respective countries.  Meanwhile, William himself was tied up in
Ireland but he was saved by a diversion by Churchill from Europe to land in southern
Ireland where he captured Cork and Kinsale to greatly relieve the King.  There would then follow a hiatus in
Churchill's career as William grew ever more jealous of the latter's skills; he
would seek to thwart his ambitions as best
he could - for a time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">  We have reached Chapter 20 in Churchill's
biography (in pages, just one third through Vol I) and must leave it at this point. All subsequent Chapters in the remaining 3
Parts of the biography deal primarily with the detail of countless
successful Battles across Europe (if mostly on the Rhine) until,
in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1710</b>, France was finally
conquered. The war had lasted from <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1690</b> to that year, incorporating latterly
the War of the Spanish Succession. It
started in Flanders and ended there 20 years later. It might have more conveniently been called the<b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal"> '20 Years War'</b>. The most crucial battle was that at Blenheim (on
the Danube) on <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">13th Aug 1704</b> -
when Marlborough crushed Tallard's
mostly French forces.  Louis had to accept that he was now
permanently on the defensive. It would still
take another 5 years to mop up the remnants - with no fighting possible during
the winters in those days.  By <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1714, </b>various <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

finally settled the essential structure and power in Europe, resulting from
that prolonged War   for at least 200 years !. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

line_height:115%;font_family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">   John
Churchill was now created a Duke   of Marlborough, and Sarah, a Duchess of same.
 They were virtual Royalty.  He died in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:

many decades,  and she in <b style="mso_bidi_font_weight:normal">1744</b>, age 90, still sharp as a tack and
not to be messed with. They oversaw
construction of Blenheim, a gift from the nation, but never resided there -
preferring their beloved Ashwell House in St Albans, with its fruit trees by
the River.  He was however  invited to observe the unveiling of a famous
portrait of himself   to be hung in the main Hall at Blenheim. He studied it silently
and carefully for several minutes and while noted for never extolling his many
victories or virtues, was heard as he turned away to say, quietly to himself,
reflectively  -There <i style="mso_bidi_font_style:
normal"><u>was</u></i> a Man-.   He was buried in Westminster Cathedral but his
body later moved to the Chapel at Blenheim, to lay permanently with Sarah
there. Over a century later, Winston S.
Churchill was born at Blenheim.   But that's another story - of another Man.   Another
Churchill !  The latter would make his way to the top of
his Nation by learning from his many mistakes; the former did so by making so few.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
