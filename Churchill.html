<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4></span><span class=rvts3> INTRODUCTION</span></p><span class=rvts3><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps2><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> When re-visiting a local National Trust property near York (England) recently&nbsp; (Beningborough Hall), my wife and I decided to take a look at the Hall itself this time - rather than just the Walled Garden&nbsp; with its interesting collection of Old Fruit Trees.&nbsp; The previous owners (the Bourchier family) haven</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t lived&nbsp; in this 3000 acre estate for&nbsp; years </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> since it housed Air Force personnel during World War II.&nbsp; Just off the impressive entrance foyer, was a small room devoted to the sale of Used Books (with profits to the Trust).&nbsp; It included a few more serious or academic choices than typical of such charity shops and I noticed a two Volume set on the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Life of the Duke of Marlborough</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5> written by his notable&nbsp; descendant Sir Winston Churchill - in the early</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>30s.&nbsp; As I knew little about the period of English history concerned, and it was rather reasonable in price, I happily bought it.&nbsp; The following is my condensed account of a major part of that earlier Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s life&nbsp; - to which has been added a deeper analysis of&nbsp;&nbsp; his&nbsp; family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s genealogy </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to augment that provided in the book itself or, indeed, as seems&nbsp; available, at least in a valid form, more generally.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with most biographies, the book begins (conveniently for our interests)&nbsp; with an account of the Churchill family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s then recent history and background.&nbsp; Whilst I</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>d pursued the genealogy of several families as a hobby some years ago, this was not my main motivation in acquiring&nbsp; the present book.&nbsp; However, I appreciated it might provide interesting insight into some common characteristics of&nbsp; two&nbsp; remarkable members of that one family, albeit living 250 years apart.&nbsp; I</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>d&nbsp; read a book some years ago by our more contemporary Churchill in which&nbsp; he&nbsp; touched briefly on his family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s origins </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; being, in the border area of Dorset and Devon, in south-west England.&nbsp; I</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>d gained an impression of&nbsp; solid English Yeoman stock who had probably taken their surname (or had been accorded such) by virtue of the earlier family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s residence near some&nbsp; church situated on a noteworthy local hill&nbsp; - around&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1300</span><span class=rvts5>, say, when&nbsp; surnames were first evolving.&nbsp; From there, in any case, they had seemingly spread and prospered&nbsp; further afield -&nbsp; being so identified henceforth.&nbsp; Belief in such an&nbsp; origin would however ultimately prove quite mistaken.</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading the present biography</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Preface renewed my awareness that Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s prose has been much praised, and appropriately so.&nbsp;&nbsp; In it, he essentially sets out the main facts on which the glowing reputation of his illustrious Ducal ancestor, </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> was based and on which the author</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s obvious worship of him was understandably founded.&nbsp; There had however been many earlier biographers of </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Marlborough</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> who, in Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s view, were clearly biased against him - for rather ambiguous reasons.&nbsp; As a result, it was taken by many that there was an enormous miss-match between his successful deeds and career on the one hand and the credit later accorded him by the British public at large, on the other.&nbsp; Later, others (of acknowledged standing) had encouraged Churchill to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>set the record straight</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> and hence this biography, entitled </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Marlborough </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> His Life and Times</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, was written, and later published by him, in</span><span class=rvts4> 1933 </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> essentially to realise this purpose (and maybe give himself some breaks from building his famous serpentine wall&nbsp; at Chartwell around that same time - during&nbsp; his so called </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>wilderness years</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Volumes</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> are more correctly described as </span><span class=rvts8>Books</span><span class=rvts5> One and Two which contained Volumes 1 and 2, </span><span class=rvts8>and</span><span class=rvts5> Volumes 3 and 4, respectively,&nbsp; of the original work,&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these 4 original </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Volumes</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> have their own sets of numbered Chapters 1 to 25+ !&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is certainly thorough and covers essentially the century from </span><span class=rvts4>1650</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts4>1750</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> that is, from the Stuart&nbsp; through to the Georgian era&nbsp; - of essentially English history.&nbsp; The genealogical coverage of the Churchill family, however, focuses more on the preceding Tudor period </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of Henry VIII - and his daughter and heir&nbsp; Elizabeth I </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> that is, mainly through the preceding </span><span class=rvts4>1500s.</span><span class=rvts5> </span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the bulk of these volumes provides immense detail of the results of the author</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s extensive&nbsp; archival research, the brief Preface is&nbsp; itself&nbsp; of considerable value in that&nbsp; much of that massive detail is summed up in more general terms there, and thus more </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>to the point</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; It is worth reproducing a little of this here (lightly paraphrased) to provide a quick overview of what is later covered in such detail, following our descriptions of the family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s intriguing history and pedigree.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>THE PREFACE</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston&nbsp; thus begins by noting that&nbsp; “..it is an interesting historical study to examine the causes of the great disparity between the glory and importance of John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s deeds and the small regard for his memory later accorded him by many of his countrymen.&nbsp;&nbsp; He commanded the Armies of Europe against the might of France (who had long sought domination)&nbsp; in 10 major campaigns, including 4 crucial battles.&nbsp; He never fought a battle he did not win, never besieged a fortress he did not take, nor ride off&nbsp; a field of battle except as victor.&nbsp; Until Napoleon a century later, no commander wielded such wide-spread success and power across Europe. The union of nearly 20 previously confederated states centred upon his person </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> when holding together the&nbsp; Grand Alliance against France&nbsp; - by both his military victories and&nbsp; his later admired diplomacy.&nbsp; In a virtual world war, involving the armies and navies of all the civilised nations, he led them against the might of that over-domineering France - for 25 years - and in so doing ultimately broke her </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> irretrievably.”&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this distils matters rather well.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This then was the British history I knew so little about </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> essentially of the period&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1660</span><span class=rvts5> - </span><span class=rvts4>1730</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Small wars were </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>two a penny</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> then, as I would soon come to realise. It was all about </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>reversing that prolonged domination in Europe of France</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, under Louis XIV&nbsp; (the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Sun King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>) -&nbsp; by way of constantly shifting&nbsp; alliances for and against him.&nbsp; And so, in a way, has it continued&nbsp; to the present&nbsp; day.&nbsp; Britain has recently voted (</span><span class=rvts4>2016</span><span class=rvts5>) to leave the E.U. but the new Prime Minister of France has just announced that maybe they could adjust&nbsp; that&nbsp; latter&nbsp; Union - to allow Britain&nbsp; to&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>re-join</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; But, he wants also certain changes in Germany </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> whose economic power&nbsp; and the value of the Euro, basically set by them, seem to account for&nbsp; Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal all ;being seriously in debt, with high unemployment.&nbsp; And so it goes.&nbsp; Who should be dominant ?&nbsp; Whose standard of living should always be just a bit better&nbsp; than anyone else</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s ?&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. ?&nbsp;&nbsp; China ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Europe ?&nbsp; Germany ?&nbsp; France ?&nbsp; India ?&nbsp; Russia ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Islam ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who basically should&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>call the shots</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - especially their own ?</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This earlier period of concern had been described initially as that of </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the Franco-Dutch war</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> or,&nbsp; if a little later, of </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the wars of William and Anne</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - essentially between France and everyone else.&nbsp; Later, the War of the Spanish Succession became embroiled in this same prolonged conflict.&nbsp; After considering the Churchill family history and pedigree, we shall focus mainly of the earlier phases of John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s life and long military, and diplomatic, career, in dealing with this on-going reality.&nbsp; His future roles in subsequent conflicts were well established by that stage (equally successfully) and will be summed up here rather more briefly </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> culminating in his victory&nbsp; at Blenheim in </span><span class=rvts4>1704</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; This saved Vienna and allowed the Grand Alliance to hold, after which Louis</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s dominance&nbsp; faded inexorably.</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such wars and battles were not focused on mere piecemeal gains in British territory or influence per se but rather as one part of “</span><span class=rvts4>the larger struggle for a Protestant Europe</span><span class=rvts5>”. Marlborough carried forward, said Churchill, all that was best of the Protestant views of both Cromwell and the Dutchman William III&nbsp; (despite the intervening monarchies of the pro-Catholic brothers Charles II and&nbsp; James II in England) - to establish the basis of our present constitution and democratic parliamentary system </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with&nbsp; its</span><span class=rvts8> established</span><span class=rvts5> Protestant churches&nbsp; (of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, respectively).&nbsp; Ironically, religion is declining all over Europe just now (except for their salaried hierarchies who still </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>talk it up</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> with a studied gravitas).&nbsp; But, are there still different cultural and religious views regarding </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>democracy</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> and&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>morality</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - and </span><span class=rvts4>who</span><span class=rvts5> should ,really </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>decide</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> things - for the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>best</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> ?&nbsp; (A value judgement if ever there was one.) </span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, as so succinctly&nbsp; expressed in the vernacular by Britain</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; recent&nbsp; Foreign Secretary - Boris Johnson - with respect to Britain leaving the European Union - “It</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s </span><span class=rvts9>not</span><span class=rvts5> about Immigration or Jobs, its simply about </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Who calls the shots</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>” (as touched on above).&nbsp; And that is about national independence, sovereignty and democracy, not export sales.&nbsp; Are grander unions of neighbouring nations inevitable or only for temporary alliances in times of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>extremis</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>?&nbsp; Who or what is </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>right,</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> or </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>best</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> ?&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>good</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>;&nbsp; or </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>bad</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; ?&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>Who decides ?</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; It</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s not any of our nations</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; 9 or 10 year old boys&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; still being told to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>go outside and play</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>;&nbsp; it is, rather, just </span><span class=rvts9>some</span><span class=rvts5> of those young lads (and now lasses)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> just a few&nbsp; years hence, when </span><span class=rvts8>one or two </span><span class=rvts5>of them suddenly </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>just&nbsp; know</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - what</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s best for the rest of us and wants to be </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the ones who decides things</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Possibly it depends on how they</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>ve been </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>conditioned</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> during their youths.&nbsp; Or, is it testosterone ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or intelligence ?&nbsp; Or an urge to fulfil&nbsp; one</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s assumed potential and </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>destiny</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> ? </span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, eventually, someone has to decide, </span><span class=rvts9>and </span><span class=rvts10>‘</span><span class=rvts9>lead</span><span class=rvts10>’</span><span class=rvts5>, presumably.&nbsp; Societies that have not evolved such leadership potential and choice methods are probably no longer here to tell a different story.&nbsp; But, is that by a democratically elected </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>cabinet</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, or by an unelected Commission (as in Europe or China) ?&nbsp; Those potential leaders who seek eventually to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>take over</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> certainly rely very much on joining like-minded sub-groups and circulating winningly amongst them </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> talking, persuading and </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>taking the lead</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but always with trusted companions;&nbsp; and of course the backing and loyalty of a well-paid Army, Police force, and Political party, certainly helps.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; a Church - with </span><span class=rvts8>its</span><span class=rvts5> leaders&nbsp; ?&nbsp; Or, must it always come down simply to&nbsp; “… the economy, stupid…” ?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had the very determined plans of Louis XIV and his senior Generals&nbsp; (some&nbsp; of those once 9 year olds) proved triumphant instead, the freedoms, religious and democratic, that we enjoy today would have been warped and restricted even more, suggests Churchill.&nbsp; This would have been the case had either Napoleon or the Kaiser (or even Hitler) later fully dominated.&nbsp; One hadn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t appreciated, previously, that just as the German race, once consolidated, sought such domination in Europe - on their two major occasions (</span><span class=rvts4>1914</span><span class=rvts5> and </span><span class=rvts4>1939),</span><span class=rvts5> so too had France -&nbsp; on their two comparable earlier occasions </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in the </span><span class=rvts4>1670-1710</span><span class=rvts5> period under Louis and, from </span><span class=rvts4>1795-1815,</span><span class=rvts5> under Napoleon.&nbsp; Everyone, it seems, must have their turn </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> essentially striving to dominate the then global economy and culture.&nbsp; With Spain, it was earlier and with Holland, a little later.&nbsp; (There had in fact also been two shorter </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Anglo-Dutch Wars</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> relevant to our story, prior to this present focus.)&nbsp; And, we mustn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t forget the British Empire, with its early control of India and North America;&nbsp; Japan&nbsp; too, and&nbsp; the USSR,&nbsp; have&nbsp; now had their&nbsp; turns.&nbsp; China next ?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marlborough</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s amazing career began from a surprisingly young age but he was consistently supported by the wisest counsels in the land - who gradually recognised his multiple talents.&nbsp; This support included the Monarchs and Dukes mentioned, as well as such Ministers of state as Halifax, Shrewsbury, Russell, Cadogan and Godolphin - who will be further identified below.&nbsp; And yet, to quote the later Churchill (in regard to his motivation in writing this biography) “fame shined unwillingly upon this future statesman and warrior whose repeated exertions brought our island and Europe safely through its perils - to produce its glorious results for Christendom”.&nbsp; While Democracy vs Dictatorship was certainly important, Religion too was much more relevant then than one had previously appreciated.&nbsp; It still is </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in places.&nbsp; Unlike the Cheetah, we, like Lions and Baboons, are a social species </span><span class=rvts6>––</span><span class=rvts5> although not </span><span class=rvts8>just </span><span class=rvts5>social, as some would prefer to believe;&nbsp; some freedom of manoeuvre for the individual must still count.&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely, the </span><span class=rvts8>right</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts8>balance</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; should prevail, according&nbsp; to current conditions and needs of any given species, at given times </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> including homo sapiens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; all evolve. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the later analyses of John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; achievements weren</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t distorted directly by the usual political suspects </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ie the Whig vs Tory interpretations of history </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as neither party at that time had sought actively either&nbsp; to defend or to&nbsp; castigate him in the round.&nbsp; A number of minor elements&nbsp; in his long career seem to have overly concerned certain historians and writers who, for more vaguely political or professional reasons, apparently sought to besmirch his name.&nbsp; This was done, said Churchill, by&nbsp; ”utilising every taunt, however bitter, every tale, however petty, every charge, however shameful or not, arising from minor incidents over a very long career.”&nbsp; Maybe it just </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>sold copy</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> for certain historians, and </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>hacks</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> of the day.&nbsp; Like most critics of talent in the Arts, Music, Sport, Literature and Architecture, say, some Historians too take their assumed and self-selected roles and critical orientation (typically without having created or accomplished anything too significant themselves)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>very</span><span class=rvts5> seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gravitas&nbsp; abounds </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> often as&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>role playing</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on such pretexts and on but one controversial incident (detailed later), a succession of famous English writers had apparently sought to insult Marlborough</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; memory and reproach his name. These included Swift, Pope, Thackeray and, especially, the historian Macaulay. More modern writers, noted Churchill, had at least begun to reverse and correct these distortions and prejudices of the previous 250 years.&nbsp; He was now to be one of them.&nbsp; I hope to analyse the complex political and cultural milieu in which John Churchill would make his mark, once into adulthood, during this unstable and complicated period in pan-European history. This is primarily to become more aware of and better understand it myself.&nbsp; You may or may not wish to join me.&nbsp;&nbsp; There </span><span class=rvts11>is</span><span class=rvts5> a lot of genealogy, ultimately </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but it may be skipped !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, as mentioned, I would firstly address the matter of the Churchill family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s apparent origins.&nbsp; This comes out in Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s first Chapter, if only gradually and intermittently, inter-twined as it is with necessary descriptions of the early years in the disrupted background of John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s parents, and grandparents, as well as of John himself. The times (essentially of the English Civil War and the ensuing Commonwealth period (dominated by Cromwell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Puritans) were very stressful and uncertain for the land-owning gentry. The Churchill family background by this stage was certainly much above that of any Yeoman level suggested earlier (with an interesting exception) but, because of those times, certain false moves could well reverse any social or economic gains in a trice.&nbsp; The future was most uncertain for many. That old&nbsp; adage of the gentry and aristocracy - </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>what we have, we hold</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> -&nbsp; was no longer as certain and achievable as had long been the case.&nbsp; But, it was often accompanied by the injunction of the same class:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Never complain, never explain</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>;&nbsp; just get on with it.&nbsp; Many did.&nbsp; Quality will out (eventually), it seems, as I hope we shall see. </span></p>

<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> was born in </span><span class=rvts4>1650</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; to an earlier Winston Churchill,&nbsp; the first in the family of that forename&nbsp; (Winstone being the&nbsp; maiden name of his mother),&nbsp; and to his wife - Elizabeth (nee Drake).&nbsp; The year </span><span class=rvts4>1650</span><span class=rvts5> is almost prophetic - falling as it did exactly mid-way between the end of the confused Civil War decade, of the </span><span class=rvts4>1640</span><span class=rvts5>s, when Charles I was eventually overthrown and executed (having rigidly insisted that, as King,&nbsp; his views on religion, and his role in it, should prevail), and the end of the following decade&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> being that of the Commonwealth under Cromwell, when the religious Puritans (Roundheads or Parliamentarians)&nbsp; were in the ascendancy&nbsp; - until </span><span class=rvts4>1660</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; John would thus grow up </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to the age of 10 at least - knowing only that latter, anti-Royalist, </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>anti-establishment culture</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> with its fundamentalist Christianity (Puritanism) that increasingly dominated then.&nbsp; Many felt that both Anglicanism and Catholicism had become too hierarchical and authoritarian, in that sphere of control.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, it was essentially “we know best” wherever one looked.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one knew then of course, including young John Churchill, that this new Puritan religious and cultural milieu </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t necessarily going to last forever</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Many Puritans, leaving for America a few years earlier, weren</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t&nbsp; too sure either.&nbsp;&nbsp; When looking back on History, it seems very difficult to ignore what we know today (and </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>they</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> didn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in their early years).&nbsp; One had to&nbsp; watch one</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s step carefully. </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our saga by Winston begins with his </span><span class=rvts4>Chapter One</span><span class=rvts5> entitled simply, but enigmatically, </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5><b>Ashe House </b></span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; This was in fact a residential property and estate in south-west Dorset that would prove to be the seat of one branch of an ancient west-country family </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>the Drakes</span><span class=rvts5> - situated just inland from the small port town of Lyme Regis (then simply Lyme).&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier relatives named Ashe had resided there previously and hence the estate</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s name. And the Drakes also held sway nearby </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at Colyton&nbsp; in Devon.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; location and relevance of Ashe House in our story becomes clear only gradually in the author</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s otherwise excellent prose.&nbsp; However, we can cut to the chase to some extent by introducing and identifying the principal players and their roles rather sooner&nbsp; than&nbsp; Sir Winston felt necessary.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We note firstly that Ashe House was situated in that Dorset-Devon border area where Churchill had roughly placed the source of his ancestors, as mentioned above.&nbsp; But this proved to be a slightly false lead.&nbsp; In fact, they seemed, initially at least, to have been established, rather earlier, further into the heart of Dorset itself, nearer the northern&nbsp; parishes of Minterne Magna and Wooton Glanville, some miles north-east.&nbsp; But, even earlier, they appear to have&nbsp; settled slightly north of that in turn - in the county of Somerset rather, and before that even&nbsp; - in Devonshire to the south.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, Ashe House (located just into south-west Dorset) was in fact but a temporary abode for the Churchills latterly </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> for about a dozen years at most.&nbsp; Their Somerset and/or Devon origins were&nbsp; much earlier and more complex.&nbsp; And before that ?&nbsp; We shall certainly see.</span></p>
<p class=rvps7><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; While John Churchill and his siblings would thus be born and grow up under wartime conditions at Ashe House near the Dorset-Devon border, this was due entirely to the temporary circumstances of their father Winston Churchill during the Civil War.&nbsp; He was a Royalist Officer in the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Army; that is, a Cavalier, supporting the King, and hence often </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>on the run</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> from capture by the increasingly ascendant Roundheads </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as they progressed successfully to their eventual victory.&nbsp; Fortunately, in a way, Winston, essentially then of Wooton Glanville, Dorset, as was his father </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill Snr</span><span class=rvts5>, a local lawyer,&nbsp; would marry the daughter of one </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Lady Eleanor Drake</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, who did reside at Ashe House. </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Fortunately</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, as she (and her then deceased husband) were, paradoxically, Puritan supporters of&nbsp; Cromwell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Roundheads </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ie on the Parliamentary side !&nbsp;&nbsp; This contrasted with most of the country </span><span class=rvts12>gentry in</span><span class=rvts5> that national conflict - where most of the&nbsp; west-country</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; rural under-classes and a few only of its&nbsp; property-owning gentry </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as the Drakes - were such supporters.&nbsp; In today</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s terms, the latter would be left-of-centre Socialists and Liberals (and often Non-conformist (Methodist) in religion), while the Royalists would typically be the land-owning Conservatives and successful Merchants </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> generally of&nbsp; an Anglican&nbsp; persuasion&nbsp; - as members of&nbsp; the established&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Church of England</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with its remarkable propensity to adapt, tolerate and survive.&nbsp; The Catholic Church was still functioning, but weak and struggling. </span></p>
<p class=rvps8><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Drake was the widow of Sir John Drake&nbsp; and being now on her own, was concerned about a rather fervent Royalist neighbour (Lord John Poulett).&nbsp; So, in </span><span class=rvts4>1644</span><span class=rvts5>, she requested that a guard of Roundheads be placed at her disposal - to protect her and her 3 daughters.&nbsp; But, before they could be fully deployed, that neighbour did indeed attack her estate and partially burn down her large manor house.&nbsp; Lady Drake and family then took refuge in the nearby port town of Lyme Regis for a time&nbsp; (already in Roundhead hands), before moving on to London for temporary accommodation, again provided by the latter powers who then held the capitol and also dominated there.&nbsp; As in the American civil war of 200 years later, many families and regions were split right down the middle </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> on either religious or economic/political/racial lines (or both). One is reminded of the Brexit controversy today </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as during </span><span class=rvts4>2015-</span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>20</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps8><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oddly, in the middle of this national conflict, it had been arranged (probably by Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father John Churchill Snr) that his son, a Royalist as himself, should marry this daughter of a noted and landed </span><span class=rvts8>Cromwellian</span><span class=rvts5> supporter.&nbsp; [It was later discovered that the Drake family had&nbsp; previously held the Manor and Castle&nbsp; of neighbouring Colyton in Devon, only 5 miles away, with which an earlier Churchill also had connections and the two families may well have known each other,&nbsp; at least from then </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> partially explaining this marriage choice.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had&nbsp; married the same year as that arson incident at Ashe House </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in </span><span class=rvts4>1644</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; But the young Churchill couple lived mostly apart from each other in those early years of their marriage </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with Elizabeth remaining with her widowed Drake mother, and her own sisters, for the next 4 years, mainly in that London accommodation recently provided for them.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps8><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proceedings were soon commenced against Lord Poulett that eventually gained her only £1500 (of the estimated £5000 damages (worth 70 or 80 times or more in today</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s currency).&nbsp; During this time, young Winston would have been stationed with his regiment in continually changing venues </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> that is, over the period </span><span class=rvts4>1645-47</span><span class=rvts5> - as the conflict still raged throughout the country in much confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, by late </span><span class=rvts4>1647</span><span class=rvts5>, he and his wife were apparently able finally to live together, but still with her mother Lady Drake </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> when the young family&nbsp; all returned to a still damaged Ashe House in south-west Dorset.&nbsp; This at least afforded them some Roundhead security, if under rather Spartan conditions for landed gentry </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in their burnt-out shell of a home. </span></p>
<p class=rvps8><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Winston was able to avoid arrest and fines by the Roundheads&nbsp; there (it being assumed to be a totally non-Royalist, non-threatening household) for the next 2 or 3 years, he was eventually brought to justice - as the Roundheads saw it </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> for having been an active </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Captain in the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s army</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; His fine, still addressed to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Winston Churchill of Wooton Glanville, Dorset, </span><span class=rvts3>Gent</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> amounted to about £450 - which was considerable for a man whose estate (a part only of that of his lawyer father&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill, </span><span class=rvts3>Esq</span><span class=rvts5> - also of Wooton) - was worth but £160 per annum (as received from its rents and profits).&nbsp;&nbsp; This left him too little to maintain his own&nbsp; marital home </span><span class=rvts8>there</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; and, in any case, his widowed father had recently re-married and, as Winston&nbsp; didn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t get on with&nbsp; his new step-mother, they soon moved back into Ashe House with his Drake mother-in-law and family, at least initially, for the protection that her status could still provide them </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [We may note here that one</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s social status in those times (and for centuries before) was described, in ascending order, as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Labourer, Husbandman, Groom, Yeoman, Gentleman (Gent) and Esquire (Esq)</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>; above this&nbsp; were the Knights&nbsp; (</span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Sirs</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>) and the Nobility (</span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Lords</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>) and finally, Royalty.&nbsp; While both Winston and his father lived at their small estate in Wooton Glanville, the father John, still its sole owner, was thus an Esq, while his adult son would remain a Gent, until and if inheriting an estate himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; At all levels, there were continual attempts to make out and aspire to be seen as being of the station just above that which the facts (if known) would typically warrant.&nbsp; If, at marriage, one falsified one</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s current social status, a fine could be levied.&nbsp; Many men working and living in the larger cities would often still be classed along these same </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>rural</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> lines - as a Groom or a Yeoman, say, even if no longer having anything to do with country estates or farming per se- (often on&nbsp; rented land - as a tenant or Yeoman/Copyholder&nbsp;&nbsp; when that status was enrolled (Copied) into the manor</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s permanent and legal Estate (manor) Records on vellum).&nbsp; The point was they had </span><span class=rvts8>to work</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with or without using their hands; a proper Gentleman (and/or Esq)&nbsp; on the other hand, didn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t </span><span class=rvts8>have</span><span class=rvts5> to;&nbsp; he would typically have&nbsp; other, more reliable,&nbsp; income sources.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was sometimes a fine distinction.] </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Esquire owned his own land (Freehold) </span><span class=rvts9>and/or</span><span class=rvts5> received sufficient&nbsp; income from it or from investments or a quality profession; a young Gentleman was often in a more precarious position (reliant on others) - just below that level - but usually quite well educated.&nbsp; Prudent Yeomen with savings could lend money to imprudent Gents and Esqs and eventually buy them out, and so ascend the social scale </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>new money</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Marriages generally entailed property agreements - with little or no cognizance taken with respect to any mutual love or affection. And primogeniture assured that estates remained essentially intact over the generations - by descending&nbsp; down only the eldest son</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s ownership;&nbsp; not split up endlessly between siblings and cousins over successive generations, as in some&nbsp; countries (eg&nbsp; France), with their own conceptions of equity, fairness and justice. </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaseholders were often of a more ambiguous status&nbsp; - as semi-gentry.&nbsp; And some </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Freeholders</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> were actually only Leaseholders if their&nbsp; property was originally held&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of the King (Crown)</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> or </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of some very early Norman Baron</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (granted it by succeeding Kings ca </span><span class=rvts4>1066-1400s</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; and since forgotten, as families died out; but actually was still really </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>owned</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> by distant others who had inherited such former Crown estates for which albeit </span><span class=rvts8>very long</span><span class=rvts5> Leases had&nbsp; eventually&nbsp; run out. Later Wills may leave property to heirs that were originally in the form of 500-year Leases which, unrealised, had run out and were invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps9><span class=rvts5>---&nbsp; ---&nbsp; ---&nbsp; ---&nbsp; ---</span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>Once settled back&nbsp; at Ashe house (</span><span class=rvts4>1648</span><span class=rvts5>), the young Churchill couple</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>first surviving child was a daughter </span><span class=rvts4>Arabella</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> born there in Feb </span><span class=rvts4>1649</span><span class=rvts5> - and their second, a son&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> (our primary subject) - on </span><span class=rvts4>26 May 1650.&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>Several others (12 in all !) would follow, but most did not survive.&nbsp; Baptisms were registered at St Michael</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s, Musbury, the nearest parish church (with some property there still owned by the Drakes) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> albeit located just inside Devonshire. The Vicar&nbsp; (with Puritan oversight?) would probably have provided some early education for the boys at least - including John and his brothers George and&nbsp; Charles - in the later </span><span class=rvts4>1650s</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; But it is more probable, notes Churchill, that their father would take control of that subsequently - as he was himself of an academic bent (having been to Oxford ca </span><span class=rvts4>1630</span><span class=rvts5>s) but with no large estate yet to manage, or a profession (beyond the Army) to pursue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, he had the time and interest to investigate his own family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s </span><span class=rvts9>uncertain genealogy and armorial status</span><span class=rvts5>, being eventually motivated to do so because of its advantages in </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>those times</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (described later).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston&nbsp; and family were finally able to return to his own property in Wooton Glanville by </span><span class=rvts4>1660</span><span class=rvts5>, after his father had died there the year before (as, coincidently, had Cromwell and his Commonwealth experiment).&nbsp; Both events would provide Winston Churchill and family with a more secure, if modest, lifestyle, estate and future </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as appeared initially at least to be the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these developments happily coincided with the </span><span class=rvts4>Restoration</span><span class=rvts5> - of the Monarchy, when Chares II&nbsp; returned from exile in France </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if still under the protection and&nbsp; financial support of Louis XIV (a fellow Catholic).&nbsp; Such events seemed to re-energise Winston Churchill. He was soon elected as M.P for the important Dorset port of Weymouth (previously held by members of the local Bond family (of Dorchester and Steeple) where they seem to have played the Roundhead </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>card</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>). And Winston also became virtually a founding member of the new Royal Society of leading academics in London.&nbsp; Many arrangements and compromises were forthcoming between the former opposing sides </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> whether based on religious or political differences. Old scores were settled and gradually parliamentary government, but </span><span class=rvts9>under a King</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; with</span><span class=rvts8> </span><span class=rvts13>his</span><span class=rvts5> ministers,&nbsp; returned </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in the </span><span class=rvts4>1660</span><span class=rvts5>s. </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Court</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of friends and family surrounding the Monarchy&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> once more became one of the realities of daily social and political life, and of economic influence, advancement and control.&nbsp; One progressed in life as much by whom you knew in that vague institution (the royal </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Court</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>), as by what you knew,&nbsp; although the latter apparently did still count to a certain extent </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and&nbsp; rather more in England than it did in more rigid France </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with its comparable&nbsp; royal Court </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> until its own Revolution a century or more later. </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this reality, Winston Churchill sought the advancement of himself and, increasingly, of his eldest son, John Churchill </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> still only 12 to 14 - as this new order evolved in the early years of that Restoration period (post-</span><span class=rvts4>1660</span><span class=rvts5>). Winston no doubt continued to oversee his son</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s education locally, but would be on the lookout for a placement for him in Royal or Court circles and/or into a good </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Public</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> school.&nbsp; His own background was in the Army (although he had briefly attended University, and one of the&nbsp; Inns of Court (where lawyers were trained)&nbsp; and he likely still had contacts in those spheres as well. Moreover, his steadfast support for the Royalist cause over the difficult years of the </span><span class=rvts4>1640s</span><span class=rvts5> and </span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>50s</span><span class=rvts5> meant that the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s advisors sought special consideration for him (and others like him) within the financial limits that Charles II found himself on his return in </span><span class=rvts4>1660 - </span><span class=rvts5>with a very&nbsp; depleted Treasury.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his account, our author Churchill remarks on the seeming special treatment his earlier namesake received for his recognised merits and services for the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s executed father Charles I, and now for his own role as an active M.P. in the new royalist parliament under Charles II.&nbsp; For one thing, his Churchill family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Coat of Arms was to be </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>augmented</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> to a higher standing, something that he was known to be seeking after his own recent investigations - of the family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s long-uncertain</span><span class=rvts4> Armorial background</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; For another, he obtained&nbsp; a position for his young son </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>, as a Page in the Royal Household&nbsp; - that of the king</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; brother </span><span class=rvts4>James, Duke of York</span><span class=rvts5> (a future king&nbsp; himself).&nbsp; Indeed, James would play a most important, on-going role in the future of young John Churchill, and thus in our story generally, over the next 25 years.&nbsp; But first… </span></p>

<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; At this point, we pause in our intended coverage of young John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s subsequent military and diplomatic career, and his rise to fame, and return to consider further his family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s origins as they unfolded long before the Civil War.&nbsp; In an examination of that earlier&nbsp; Coat of Arms, Winston found </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> likely with the help of the long established College of Arms in London, and any early published pedigrees then available - that the Churchill&nbsp; Arms appeared to be based on a rather ancient one of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Otho de Leon</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, who was&nbsp; described as the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Castelan de Gisorn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (seemingly in Leon in France), before </span><span class=rvts4>1000</span><span class=rvts5> AD !&nbsp;&nbsp; Otho&nbsp; was said to have had two sons </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Richard (b. ca </span><span class=rvts4>1020</span><span class=rvts5>) and Wandrill (b. ca </span><span class=rvts4>1025</span><span class=rvts5>) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the latter referred to as the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Lord of</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>Courcelles</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; “…whose youngest son (unnamed) came into England in </span><span class=rvts4>1066,</span><span class=rvts5> with William the Conqueror.” </span></p>

<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case,&nbsp; it thus&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>appears</span><span class=rvts5> that the original source of the family and its name very likely does not derive </span><span class=rvts8>from</span><span class=rvts5> some </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>church relevant hill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> in southern England&nbsp; (whether Dorset, Somerset or Devon) but, rather, ultimately&nbsp; from a manor or district called something like </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Courcelles</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> in Normandy,&nbsp; France&nbsp; !&nbsp; That early English manor (and later village),&nbsp; in Somerset, had thus acquired its name </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>eventually as&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - </span><span class=rvts11>from</span><span class=rvts8>&nbsp; the first </span><span class=rvts15>principal family</span><span class=rvts5> to settled there </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> by about </span><span class=rvts4>1150</span><span class=rvts5> - rather than the other way around.&nbsp; This village and parish of Churchill remains there to this day, thus named,&nbsp; Is there a church </span><span class=rvts8>and</span><span class=rvts5> a note-worthy hill nearby </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> or not ?&nbsp; Most&nbsp; probably not.&nbsp;&nbsp; There would in fact be 5 or 6 other early Manors and villages in scattered locations across the southern counties which all had this same&nbsp; French-sounding name and&nbsp; origin, but from rather earlier </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> by&nbsp; about </span><span class=rvts4>1070</span><span class=rvts5> or so. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [We may note that, for a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>consideration</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, the&nbsp; College of Arms (or some in it) have been known&nbsp; to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>help</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> one&nbsp; establish an apparently valid pedigree. There appears to be sufficient evidence in the Churchill case however not to have required any such suspect assistance </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as will become apparent.

<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, we have found that near Kidderminster, in Worcestershire, the Great Book lists (in folio 117r)&nbsp; a Manor called then </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Cercehalle</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (now Churchill) with 40 inhabitants in </span><span class=rvts4>1086. </span><span class=rvts5>Their</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>names were about 15% Norman French and 85% Anglo-Saxon);&nbsp; near Banbury in Oxfordshire was another early settlement called </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Cerecelle</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (now Churchill) where many of the&nbsp; inhabitants (or property holders often residing&nbsp; elsewhere) appeared to be quite high ranking, with titles and important church positions.&nbsp; Another in Worcestershire&nbsp; was called </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Circhehille</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>;&nbsp; and finally there was at least one in Devonshire (folio 11r)&nbsp; called </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Cercelle</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> with 28 inhabitants</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> names having&nbsp; this same early Norman:Anglo-Saxon balance.&nbsp; This Devon </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> was located near Exeter, I believe, and is discussed further below.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A generation later, King Stephen (</span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of Blois</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>) reigned from </span><span class=rvts4>1135 </span><span class=rvts5>to </span><span class=rvts4>1154,</span><span class=rvts5> during which time a rival cousin, (Empress Matilda), also claimed the English throne - resulting in a protracted mini-civil war, ending about </span><span class=rvts4>1153</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; [I have recently been reminded that just north of my present location (in Northallerton, North Yorkshire), Stephen&nbsp; fought the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Battle of the Standard</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> as early as&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1138</span><span class=rvts5> - against Matilda</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; Scottish supporters </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Stephen</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s side again winning.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>In the south,</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>Bartholomew had supported Stephen (as we are informed by Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s uncertain&nbsp; source) but died doing so in about </span><span class=rvts4>1152 </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>in the west country at or near Bristol Castle, in Somerset.&nbsp; The considerable lands acquired previously by the first&nbsp; Churchill(s)&nbsp; ca</span><span class=rvts4> 1066</span><span class=rvts5> to ca </span><span class=rvts4>1130</span><span class=rvts5>, say (and still held in </span><span class=rvts4>1086</span><span class=rvts5>), mostly in Somerset,&nbsp; may have been compromised, however,&nbsp; during&nbsp; those&nbsp; early- to mid-</span><span class=rvts4>1100s </span><span class=rvts5>by some Royal dictat&nbsp; (after a change of King), but some time after this&nbsp; some advantages again accrued to the&nbsp; family&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as when the next Churchill of note had&nbsp; provided Stephen (as well as the next monarch (Henry 1</span><span class=rvts16>st</span><span class=rvts5>) with much needed support in&nbsp; those dangerous and competitive&nbsp; times.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There doesn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t appear to have been any attempt to discover any specific spread of the first one or two male </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Churchills</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (Courcelles) from&nbsp; their arrival&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1066</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; -&nbsp; before settling in such as the west country, or in any other particular region.&nbsp; All we can say is that they seem to have appeared quite early in Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Worcestershire, Somerset, Devon, and even Dorset - by the late 11</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> early 12</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> century. We shall however describe later another Norman family (the Bartelots; later Bartletts) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> possibly related to William de l</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>Eu (a considerable early Norman land owner)&nbsp; - who also benefitted from their role in protecting certain chief Barons and their families (often Royal relatives) who had received grants of property from King William , in widely disbursed locations.&nbsp;&nbsp; (This purposive dispersal to obviate cliques of close relatives and friends from later having&nbsp; a </span><span class=rvts8>more cohesive power-base</span><span class=rvts5> - from which&nbsp; to attempt rebellion) and as a result the Bartelots were able themselves to settle near those scattered Nobles</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - through grants of local land from </span><span class=rvts8>that</span><span class=rvts5> chief Baron, in turn. These would be confirmed by  their initially  French surnames </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> now holding smaller Manors in such areas.&nbsp; Three or four other families of similar status apparently inter-married, seemed to be distributed likewise, if less widely or reliably, in those same areas -&nbsp; mostly </span><span class=rvts9>in the south and west of England.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of these families was indeed the Churchills </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> one son of whom (Bartholomew) seems to have&nbsp; benefitted by his relationship with a Baron Ralph FitzRalph…(and marrying his sister)&nbsp; while&nbsp; serving Kings Stephen or Henry 2</span><span class=rvts16>st</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; in Somerset and Devon.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is </span><span class=rvts8>this</span><span class=rvts5> branch of the family&nbsp; that we shall seek to trace out </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> from their apparent beginnings before their later association with a manor eventually called  Churchill in Somerset - without knowing if any other branches (of </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>de Courcelles</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, etc) had survived or prospered elsewhere (as land-holders rather than, subsequently, as Yeomen), </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as in Devon or Dorset.&nbsp; We shall describe a situation later where the early Churchills appear to have spread from Somerset south to Devon and </span><span class=rvts8>then </span><span class=rvts15>east</span><span class=rvts5> to Dorset.&nbsp; The latter could well have linked up there, however, around</span><span class=rvts4> 1500,</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; with&nbsp; another branch which may have spread more directly from Sussex </span><span class=rvts15>west</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; into Hampshire and then into south-east Dorset. This would occur&nbsp; through the </span><span class=rvts4>1200s&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts4>1400</span><span class=rvts5>s, say - unless their presence there, (as near Corton, Dorset)&nbsp; may even&nbsp; have preceded </span><span class=rvts4>1066 </span class=rvts4> ,as discussed later</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [</span><span class=rvts4>NB</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have, since writing the above,&nbsp; come across an Internet&nbsp; site that lists&nbsp; the major land-holders in each county at the time of </span><span class=rvts4>the Domesday Survey</span><span class=rvts5> (</span><span class=rvts4>1086</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; The first impression was of the enormous number of Manors (mostly now parishes and villages) somehow then held by about a dozen or so of William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s original Barons and Tenants-in-Chief&nbsp; - in many different&nbsp; counties (if sometimes, if rarely,&nbsp; concentrated&nbsp; in just one or two).&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these were then sub-let to a range of&nbsp; local citizens </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> whether Normans or Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp; Their lands were&nbsp; often described as being “ ...held&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>of</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (or&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>from</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5>)</span><span class=rvts13>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> one of those&nbsp; few named Norman Barons&nbsp; or Tenants-in- Chief.” Above them, everything&nbsp; was affectively held ultimately </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of the Crown</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.</span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I first examined this situation for Somerset (quite arbitrarily) and discovered that one of (if not</span><span class=rvts8> the</span><span class=rvts5>) Tenant-in-Chief there,&nbsp; by and before </span><span class=rvts4>1086</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; was a&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Roger de Couriceulles</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5> - who effectively </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>owned</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> or </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>held</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> over </span><span class=rvts4>80</span><span class=rvts5> such Manors in that one county !!&nbsp;&nbsp; Oddly, however, when one checked for such&nbsp; details with respect specifically to those Manors soon to be re-named such as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Cercelle</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> or similar (from just after </span><span class=rvts4>1066, say</span><span class=rvts5>) in Oxfordshire, Worcestershire or Devon, (all later to become, and be known as, </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Churchill</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5>),&nbsp; the then current </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>owners</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (holders), at or soon </span><span class=rvts9>after</span><span class=rvts3> 1086</span><span class=rvts4>,</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; did not included any individuals named Courecelles&nbsp; or similar. Nevertheless, there would later be quite a few in those general areas with the&nbsp; Churchill form of that surname</span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> probably descended from younger sons or cousins of those earlier Norman land </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>owners</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (typically the elder son) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who, it seems, didn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t actually reside there themselves by then. Those later residents would&nbsp; generally have become&nbsp; Yeomen&nbsp; - who had to&nbsp; pay rent to some such absentee landowner </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> often re-granted the Manor concerned&nbsp; by some&nbsp; later Baron or King who had&nbsp; gained or seized&nbsp; their control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then checked for Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; similar involvement then&nbsp; (</span><span class=rvts4>1086</span><span class=rvts5> or before)&nbsp; in Devon but this proved to be much less the case than in Somerset..

<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That early Somerset manor, to be known later as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (not yet noted in the Doomsday Book but likely&nbsp; established by Bartholomew a little later&nbsp; (</span><span class=rvts4>1140-50</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; was, in any case, sold much later&nbsp; (after that blank period) to a landed family named J</span><span class=rvts4>ennings</span><span class=rvts5> - who held it from about </span><span class=rvts4>1550</span><span class=rvts5> for a further century.&nbsp; During this extended period (200+ years), the later Churchills would presumably have had to survive locally, or elsewhere nearby, as best they could, depending on what other resources, marriages, educations or properties they may have managed to arrange, hold or acquire </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> while ever seeking to maintain some social and economic standing.&nbsp; But, the detail of the family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s history over that 200 year period appeared, initially, to be&nbsp; rather&nbsp; scant and uncertain - at this point. </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a consequence, as pointed out by our more contemporary Winston, the family may have become distributed into many levels of society in Oxford, Somerset, Worcestershire, Devon and Dorset through the </span><span class=rvts4>12th</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts4>14th </span><span class=rvts5>centuries, with some elements hopefully still sufficiently educated and moneyed to resume their former positions and status - at the Gentleman and Esquire levels (that is, certainly above that of Husbandman or Yeoman), as conditions allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Thus, we may consider the rather </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>up-market</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> marriage&nbsp; (</span><span class=rvts4>1472</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; of a later </span><span class=rvts4>Charles Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> to a Margaret Wydville/Woodville -&nbsp; an apparent relative of the then Queen). ).&nbsp; Where did they live then ? At what level ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What social contacts did they have ca </span><span class=rvts4>1460-90</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - still in south Devon ?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recall that the Jennings bought the Somerset estate a little later,&nbsp; around </span><span class=rvts4>1550,</span><span class=rvts5> and were&nbsp; forced to sell it in </span><span class=rvts4>1652</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; -&nbsp; to clear debts arising from the recent English Civil war </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a common problem among the gentry at the time (if one was on the wrong side).&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>Who</span><span class=rvts5> would then be able to buy it - in that later C</span><span class=rvts8>ommonwealth</span><span class=rvts5> period (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1650-60</span><span class=rvts5>), say (with some implied fore-shadowing&nbsp; - to be clarified below).</span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings us back to those later times&nbsp; of </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill, Esq</span><span class=rvts5>, (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1630s-</span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>50s</span><span class=rvts5>), the Dorset lawyer of Wooton Glanville, and his son and grandson&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts9>Winston</span><span class=rvts5> and </span><span class=rvts9>John Jnr</span><span class=rvts5> (of the Civil War period,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>and</span><span class=rvts5> its aftermath&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1660s</span><span class=rvts5>) - with</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> the latter John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s life&nbsp; still being our ultimate focus.&nbsp; We have assumed that during the </span><span class=rvts4>16</span><span class=rvts17>th</span><span class=rvts5> century and the Tudor reigns mainly of Henry 8</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> and his daughter Elizabeth 1st, there were still some senior Churchills in that </span><span class=rvts15>general west country</span><span class=rvts9> area</span><span class=rvts5> - connecting us back to the earlier Somerset family and their&nbsp; manor of Churchill (near Bristol). This was many generations earlier of course </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> through the confusions and troubles of the </span><span class=rvts4>1400s</span><span class=rvts5> (with its Wars of the Roses)&nbsp; and into the ensuing, more stable, Tudor period of the 1</span><span class=rvts4>500s</span><span class=rvts5>. But, between the two, we have all those above questions to try to answer. </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These will hopefully be better answered once we have read Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s account (as conveyed by his later namesake) in regard to </span><span class=rvts9>the history of the family</span><span class=rvts10>’</span><span class=rvts9>s Arms and Manor(s</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; For he points out that, confusingly, there was, after the Elizabethan era, </span><span class=rvts8>another,</span><span class=rvts5> contemporary </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>, also a noteworthy lawyer, who achieved great distinction in both the&nbsp; pre-&nbsp; and&nbsp; post-Commonwealth&nbsp; periods </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but in </span><span class=rvts4>London</span><span class=rvts5>, rather than in Wessex.</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was during the later stages of Charles&nbsp; I</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s reign,&nbsp; then through Cromwell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s ascendancy&nbsp; and into&nbsp; the Restoration of Charles II </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> post-1</span><span class=rvts4>660</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does this new John Churchill (and </span><span class=rvts15>his</span><span class=rvts5> forebears) fit in, we must ask ? He appears to have later been&nbsp; fully&nbsp; in neither political nor religious camp in those early to mid-</span><span class=rvts4>1600</span><span class=rvts5>s. </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, he was (eventually) a knighted </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts13>Sir</span><span class=rvts4> John Churchill</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5>, who had risen to hold the significant legal posts of Attorney General and latterly </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Master of the Rolls</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, by the </span><span class=rvts4>1670s</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> advancing in stature from the </span><span class=rvts4>1640</span><span class=rvts5>s onwards - when he continued to thrive&nbsp; and advance under Cromwell.&nbsp; Such a sustained position would suggest he wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t necessarily of either a Roundhead or Royalist disposition, but someone who kept his cards close to his chest.&nbsp; Indeed, he turned out to be a rather bright and influential character, if a bit of a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>chancer</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, who sometimes sailed rather close to the wind.&nbsp; Moreover, with his success, he</span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>d acquired sufficient wealth to retire - to the west country himself - and purchase an estate there - namely, that at </span><span class=rvts4>Churchill&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>in north Somerset (!)</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>- from&nbsp; the </span><span class=rvts4>Jennings</span><span class=rvts5> (who, unexpectedly,&nbsp; re-enter our story again in a totally different context, and rather significantly, later).&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This London lawyer, </span><span class=rvts4>Sir John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>, was thus undoubtedly another descendent of this same one line of Churchills - one who also seems to have sought to re-establish the family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; origins and bona fides after the war </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> through the purchase of that earlier family Manor, one that we would assume was relevant to their common descent.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was&nbsp; born around </span><span class=rvts4>1620, </span><span class=rvts5>oddly similar to that of our earlier Winston, and to later be seeking much the same thing.&nbsp; Sir John Churchill was thus younger than Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father, also a John Churchill (the </span><span class=rvts8>Dorset</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; lawyer) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> then of&nbsp; Wooton Glanville, Esq)&nbsp; - who was&nbsp; born near the end of the previous century </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a generation earlier.&nbsp; Training in Law was centred then at the Inns of Court in London and our older Dorset lawyer John, a Royalist (Cavalier) and member of Middle Temple (one of 4 or 5 such </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Inns of Court</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>), would surely have known this slightly younger, and eventually more illustrious legal </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>cousin</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> -&nbsp; who was to become, and die as,&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Sir John Churchill,&nbsp; Master of the Rolls</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> one of the highest legal potions in the land, </span></p>
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the younger man succeeded the older in a position of Deputy Master of Chancery,&nbsp; even if they had trained at different Inns:&nbsp;&nbsp; John of Dorset&nbsp; at Middle Temple (from </span><span class=rvts4>1614</span><span class=rvts5>) and </span><span class=rvts8>Sir</span><span class=rvts5> John of London (to be) at Lincoln</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Inn - (from </span><span class=rvts4>1638, </span><span class=rvts5>somewhat later), both pre-Civil&nbsp; war&nbsp; days.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that latter John, the times had apparently been quite good - in both Cromwell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s </span><span class=rvts4>1650</span><span class=rvts5>s, when that ancient Somerset estate became conveniently available </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts15>and</span><span class=rvts5>, subsequently as noted,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>after</span><span class=rvts5> the Restoration, post-</span><span class=rvts4>1660.&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>He was thus a kind of </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Vicar of Bray</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> character.&nbsp; His elder lawyer </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>cousin</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, on the other hand, back in Dorset, suffered somewhat for his continued adherence and loyalty to the </span><span class=rvts8>Royal cause </span><span class=rvts5>alone, as would his son Winston Churchill in turn, now a contemporary of this beknighted </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>cousin</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> -&nbsp; the first Sir John Churchill.&nbsp; But, ultimately, Winston would match him </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> becoming an MP, a founder of the Royal Society and father of the future&nbsp; Duke of Marlborough </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to be given Blenheim Palace !&nbsp; Sir John, on the other hand,&nbsp; had 4 daughters </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who&nbsp; later became&nbsp; an awkward expense to marry off !&nbsp; He was </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>broke</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> by the end.</span></p>
<p class=rvps11><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A clue to the connection between these two branches of the Churchill family (and to those who held the Churchill manor earlier) is provided by a later comment made by our said Winston&nbsp; when he first refers to the forename of his own grandfather </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> one </span><span class=rvts13>Jasper</span><span class=rvts4> Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> that is, father of his&nbsp; own father&nbsp; John&nbsp; Churchill, Esq, the&nbsp; Dorset lawyer (who was born, it now appears, about&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1592).&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>The latter man</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s now revealed father&nbsp; Jasper&nbsp; was thus, in turn, likely born about</span><span class=rvts4> 1570&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>-&nbsp; in mid-Elizabethan&nbsp; times.&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>Moreover, Winston also usefully names&nbsp; this Jasper</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s own father - as one&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts13>Mathew</span><span class=rvts4> Churchil</span><span class=rvts5>l&nbsp; (bn. ca </span><span class=rvts4>1545</span><span class=rvts5>), near the end of Henry 8th</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s reign.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Mathew&nbsp; in turn, it seems, was&nbsp; the only a&nbsp; son&nbsp; of&nbsp; one&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts13>Roger</span><span class=rvts4> Churchill&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> likely born himself about </span><span class=rvts4>1515-20 </span><span class=rvts5>or so, as estimated) - quite early in&nbsp; Henry</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s reign.&nbsp;&nbsp; This </span><span class=rvts4>Roger Churchill </span><span class=rvts5>will long remain an important enigma in our&nbsp; searches </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with little or no documentary sources (evidence) confidently attached to his name, identity and history.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps11><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We note that the latter John Churchill (the Dorset lawyer of Wooton Granville and, later, nearby Minterne Magna), was described by our more contemporary (20</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> century) Winston&nbsp; as the one who most improved the fortunes of</span><span class=rvts8> </span><span class=rvts13>his&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>branch of the Churchill family at least </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> having, as mentioned,&nbsp; become a Deputy Registrar in Chancery, as well as being a member of Middle Temple in London himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had&nbsp; married quite well </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> into the aristocratic Winstone family of Gloucestershire </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and, as a Cavalier, did equally well for his eldest son Winston in turn - in arranging </span><span class=rvts9>his</span><span class=rvts5> marriage&nbsp; - to Elizabeth, daughter of </span><span class=rvts4>Sir John Drake</span><span class=rvts5>, of that important&nbsp; west country family.&nbsp; The latter family&nbsp; was, albeit, of&nbsp; a&nbsp; more liberal Parliamentary persuasion who, incidentally, had earlier produced </span><span class=rvts4>Sir Francis Drake</span><span class=rvts5>, the famous Elizabethan explorer and of that branch at Musbury and Colyton, Devon - near Ashe House.</span></p>

<p class=rvps11><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a successful Esq of the early </span><span class=rvts4>1600</span><span class=rvts5>s, that latter John Churchill&nbsp; may well have had contacts with such as the Winstone family (of distant Gloucester) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as through&nbsp; a fellow law student in London of that family.&nbsp; We shall place his position in the family more clearly below.&nbsp; This John&nbsp; may not have&nbsp; practised as&nbsp; an active&nbsp; lawyer however but would likely put his legal training to good use (as many&nbsp; thus&nbsp; educated then did)&nbsp; when&nbsp; inheriting and managing a family&nbsp; estate&nbsp; with&nbsp; its often&nbsp; litigious implications (as when being claimed by others on dubious grounds).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps11><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The younger,&nbsp; middle one of&nbsp; our three&nbsp; John Churchill lawyers </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> he of Wooton Granville (bn ca </span><span class=rvts4>1592</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; was able subsequently to purchase a little more Dorset property - at Newton Montecito (near Wooton) and at Minterne Magna (just to&nbsp; the south), in which the family appears to have had an earlier interest - thus improving the overall value of their otherwise modest mid-Dorset estate.&nbsp; All this would presumably be inherited by son Winston by </span><span class=rvts4>1660</span><span class=rvts5>, just after his father John died, and the Monarchy had been restored </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to Charles II. </span></p>
<p class=rvps11><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the younger </span><span class=rvts4>Sir John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the London lawyer- also did well in this regard - having married Susan Prideaux, daughter of&nbsp; Cromwell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Attorney General - Sir Edmund Prideaux&nbsp; - of Devon, and later buying that&nbsp; former Churchill manor in Somerset.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had 4 daughters&nbsp;&nbsp; but no son. Marrying them off would&nbsp; prove quite an expense for him in his future retirement years. This&nbsp; type of problem had apparently happened&nbsp; quite often in earlier periods of </span><span class=rvts9>the&nbsp; main Churchill family descent,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> as we shall see.&nbsp; A paucity of viable sons but several daughters would soon diminish the worth of the original Churchill estates and their longer&nbsp; term security.&nbsp; [Oddly, and ironically, the son of this John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s younger brother, Jasper, would later be in a position to help </span><span class=rvts8>him</span><span class=rvts5> (and others in financial trouble) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to be described later.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps11><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elder Jasper</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father </span><span class=rvts4>Mathew</span><span class=rvts5> (b. ca </span><span class=rvts4>1545</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; and his father in turn&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts4>Roger</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (b. ca </span><span class=rvts4>1518)&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> would&nbsp; take us back nearer&nbsp; that&nbsp; uncertain period during the&nbsp;&nbsp; early</span><span class=rvts4> 1500s&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> -&nbsp; long after the Churchill estate&nbsp; in Somerset had&nbsp; apparently been seized&nbsp; or somehow lost, but much before&nbsp; it had been purchased by the&nbsp; early Jennings&nbsp; - in mid-Tudor times (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1550)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>and</span><span class=rvts4>/</span><span class=rvts5>or subsequently lost by&nbsp; them,&nbsp; and (re)-purchased by Sir John Churchill, a century later.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps11><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Note that until the times of the three Lawyers and their issue (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1620-50</span><span class=rvts5>s), our dates for their respective forefathers, and those of said </span><span class=rvts4>Jasper, Mathew </span><span class=rvts5>and</span><span class=rvts4> Roger Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; have often had to be estimated on the basis of&nbsp; any&nbsp; available evidence, if often&nbsp; piecemeal and of uncertain validity, via often unreliable&nbsp; Internet sources that are often quoted and re-quoted quite uncritically.&nbsp;&nbsp; They may well be </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>out</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> by 15 % or more&nbsp; either way and thus earlier generations can quickly become significantly&nbsp; mis-placed in our temporal analysis&nbsp; (and in its spatial one also).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would hope however to locate more accurate supporting evidence subsequently - to further consolidate our understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Yes </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a little more is now at hand; see below, but proper source material is still very reluctant to reveal itself.]&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, church records of births and marriages were&nbsp; not&nbsp; registered before </span><span class=rvts4>1538</span><span class=rvts5> and, even then, often later lost or destroyed </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as may have been&nbsp; property and legal documents;&nbsp; And archive searches entail deciphering difficult early English or Latin script that can be&nbsp; small,&nbsp; faded&nbsp; and&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>very</span><span class=rvts5> time-consuming.]</span></p>
<p class=rvps11><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basis and means of affording educations for the latter two young lawyers (uncle and nephew) during the Stuart era and Civil War period&nbsp; is obviously a major factor in the family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s rehabilitation and subsequent progress.

In the early days of the Conqueror's reign the See of Wells had recovered the manor of Banwell, which had been wrested from it by Harold, but there are signs in Domesday that the imposition of knight-service on lands of the Church (ie by Laymen rather than Churchmen), was already making itself felt in the frequent mention of knights (</span><span class=rvts22>milites</span><span class=rvts19>) as their Arms became increasingly quartered [and boarded] in respect to the&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts20>B</span><span class=rvts19>ishop's many former manors. </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts19>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “</span><span class=rvts23>But the famous abbey of Glastonbury was the chief sufferer in Somerset;&nbsp; its chroniclers' complained of the loss of its lands by their gradual distribution among the Norman knights are confirmed by the Domesday Survey</span><span class=rvts19>. Portions of its&nbsp; thegn lands (of the former Anglo-Saxons) were annexed to that&nbsp; fief of the Bishop of Coutances, but its chief loss was caused by the imposition onto that Abbey of a </span><span class=rvts22>quota</span><span class=rvts19> of forty knights.&nbsp; To supply this large contingent, knights had to be enfeoffed, which involved the practical alienation of many manor thus transferred to them&nbsp; (and to other influential Boron-like&nbsp; Normans).&nbsp; Tillhuus,&nbsp; the Domesday Survey (</span><span class=rvts20>1086</span><span class=rvts19>) shows a very large number of these&nbsp; in the hands of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts20>Roger de Courcelles, </span><span class=rvts19>initially, but about 30 or more years later his&nbsp; successors&nbsp; [mostly not his own descendants] </span><span class=rvts21>–</span><span class=rvts19> found they&nbsp;&nbsp; were&nbsp; either taken back by the Crown,&nbsp; given to some more trusted Barons or simply sold on when the Royal finances were&nbsp; low.]&nbsp; Muchelney was only called upon to provide one knight and Athelney escaped free.”&nbsp; [We also find the following]:</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts19>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “With the church lands, as with those held by the King,&nbsp; Domesday reveals that there was a lack of any systematic rules for&nbsp; allocating same to the invading forces.&nbsp; Thus, under the fief&nbsp; of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts20>Roger 'de Corcelle'</span><span class=rvts19>&nbsp; we read that his at Puckington had formerly been held&nbsp; 'of St. Peter's (once thought to be&nbsp; Muchelney Abbey) . Yet under Muchelney's prior fiefdom we cannot trace Puckington or find that Abbey making any claim to this Manor.&nbsp; But, with the help of the&nbsp; Exeter Survey, we discover that Domesday only accounts for 11&nbsp; 5/8; Hides of desmesne, 5 hides in the hands of the villeins, and 2 hides of encroachment.&nbsp; There remains, therefore, to be accounted for 1&nbsp; 3/8 hide portion , which would more than cover this new holding of Roger. The fact that such encroachments are sometimes recorded under the religious houses affected, and sometimes not, makes it extremely difficult to trace them out.”&nbsp; [And again]:</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts19>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “A curious feature also noted n in the major [Exchequer] Domesday Book</span><span class=rvts21>’</span><span class=rvts19>s coverage for Somerset&nbsp; [in contrast to that of the Exeter Domesday) is the appearance of a Maltese Cross in drawn in the margin of the text, against the entries of certain Manors.&nbsp; We find it against the Count of Mortain's manors of Crowcombe and Heal, of which he had effectively&nbsp; robbed St. Swithun (of Winchester) , as of Tintinhull and Kingstone Manors -&nbsp; of which he had also deprived Glastonbury. It calls our attention&nbsp;&nbsp; also to the fact that </span><span class=rvts20>Roger de Corcelles</span><span class=rvts19> was holding land at Long Sutton&nbsp; which two English thegns had previously held </span><span class=rvts21>‘</span><span class=rvts19>of Athelney Abbey</span><span class=rvts21>’</span><span class=rvts19>;&nbsp; ie -&nbsp; 'et non poterant ab ea separari';&nbsp; it also stamps Roger Arundel as the wrongful holder of Ash Priors, stolen from the Bishop of Wells; and it stands against the record of Glastonbury's right to Brompton Ralph and Clatworthy, two manors which William de Mohun had contrived to annex to his own fief.”&nbsp; [It</span><span class=rvts21>’</span><span class=rvts19>s hard to believe, but descendants of the Courcelle, Mortain and Mohun families&nbsp; (by then as&nbsp; Churchill, Martin and Moon) were still gaining manors suspiciously when the Monasteries were being&nbsp; dissolved by Henry VIII ca </span><span class=rvts20>1540</span><span class=rvts19>s; see much later.] </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts19>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “But it does not distinguish all the losses which had been inflicted on the Church.

Glastonbury and Athelney, which had suffered most at the hands of the newcomers [from France] , group together, at the end of their fiefs, some of their chief losses, from which we learn that </span><span class=rvts20>Roger de Corcelle</span><span class=rvts19> had been preceded by his father [</span><span class=rvts20>Wandrill de Corcelle</span><span class=rvts19>] , who had obtained Limington by giving in exchange five hides which he held of Glastonbury, with no power to separate them therefrom.

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts19>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>We insert instead a quote regarding the chief culprit in these regards:</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts19>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Of the Lay (ie non-Church) tenants,&nbsp; the </span><span class=rvts21>‘</span><span class=rvts19> </span><span class=rvts20>Count&nbsp; Robert&nbsp; de Mortain</span><span class=rvts19>,&nbsp; half-brother to the Conqueror (as was Odo, made Archbishop of Canterbury), was by far the most important;&nbsp; it was&nbsp; reckoned that&nbsp; the assessment of his Manors&nbsp; was over 342 hides and their annual value at £346 6</span><span class=rvts22>s</span><span class=rvts19>. 4</span><span class=rvts22>d</span><span class=rvts19>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures for the fief of the Bishop of Coutances are slightly in excess of both these, but the Count could claim, like the Bishop, that he held nearly a tenth of the county, whether from the standpoint of assessment, or from that of annual value.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Tenant-in-Chief in twenty counties, the Count can hardly be said to be associated especially with any one, unless it was that of Cornwall, in which he practically reigned supreme; for whether he was actually its Earl or not, he was virtually the only</span><span class=rvts21>’</span><span class=rvts19> lay Tenant-in-Chief</span><span class=rvts21>’</span><span class=rvts19> within its borders.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts19>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Somerset, however, he also had a connection of a special kind, for it was there that he raised his castle of 'Montacute,'&nbsp; which became, on the breaking up of his fief, the head of a great 'Honour' [a group of very many&nbsp; Manors]&nbsp;&nbsp; comprising his broad estates in the counties of Somerset and Dorset.&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts20>Robert de Mortain</span><span class=rvts25>’</span><span class=rvts20>s</span><span class=rvts19> share of the spoils of England </span><span class=rvts23>was greater than that of any other single&nbsp; man</span><span class=rvts19>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Manor upon manor among the dashing streams of Devonshire,&nbsp; the hills&nbsp; of Somerset and much of Dorset&nbsp; c</span><span class=rvts23>ame to him</span><span class=rvts19> including by an exchange with an ecclesiastical body, the possession of which, like the possession of Pevensey, seemed to mark him out as the very embodiment of the overthrow of England.&nbsp; The Count further improved his home estate by obtaining Tintinhull, close to Montacute, from Glastonbury Abbey, to which he gave 'in exchange' Camerton, south-west of Bath, a manor of not half its value.”</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts19>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Next in importance to the fief of the Count of Mortain were those of </span><span class=rvts20>Roger de Corcelle.&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts19> [Others of near importance were Roger Arundel and William de Mohun.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The holdings of the first of these (Roger de Courcelle) , covered&nbsp; more than five columns of DomesdayBook (!).

Stephen narrowly escaped drowning on the White Ship with William in 1</span><span class=rvts4>120</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; William's death had left the succession&nbsp; open to challenge. When Henry died in 1</span><span class=rvts4>135</span><span class=rvts5>, Stephen quickly crossed the Channel&nbsp; and, </span><span class=rvts9>with the help of his brother <Henry, Bishop of Winchester</a><span class=rvts9> Abbot of Glastonbury</a><span class=rvts9>, took the throne</span><span class=rvts5>, arguing that the preservation of order across the kingdom took priority over his earlier oaths to support the claim of Henry I's daughter, the Empress Matilda.&nbsp; [Clearly, Glastonbury was of major significance to our Roger.]</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The early years of Stephen's reign were largely successful, despite a series of attacks on his possessions in England.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1</span><span class=rvts4>138</span><span class=rvts5>, the Empress's half-brother Robert of Gloucester</a><span class=rvts5> rebelled against Stephen, threatening civil war. Together with his close advisor, aleran de Beaumont</a><span class=rvts5>, Stephen took firm steps to defend his rule, including arresting a powerful family of Bishops. When the Empress and Robert invaded in 1</span><span class=rvts4>139</span><span class=rvts5>, Stephen was unable to crush the revolt rapidly, and it took hold in </span><span class=rvts9>the south-west of England</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Captured at the&nbsp; battle of Lincoln in </span><span class=rvts4>1141</span><span class=rvts5>, he was abandoned by many of his followers.&nbsp; He was freed only after his wife and one of his military commanders, captured Robert at the Rout of Winchester</a><span class=rvts5>, but the war dragged on for many years. </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephen became increasingly concerned with ensuring that his son would inherit his throne and found himself in a sequence of increasingly bitter arguments with his senior clergy.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1</span><span class=rvts4>153</span><span class=rvts5>, the Empress's son, Henry, invaded England and built an alliance of powerful </span><span class=rvts9>regional Barons</span><span class=rvts5> to support his claim for the throne. .&nbsp; [Bartholomew had fought for Stephen ca </span><span class=rvts4>145-52</span><span class=rvts5> and was rewarded with his Manor at </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (near Bristol) around this same time.]&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that year Stephen and Henry agreed to the Treaty of Winchester</a><span class=rvts5>, in which Stephen recognised Henry as his heir in exchange for peace, passing over William</a><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; Stephen's second son.

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may now better appreciate how tenuous were the property rights of the early Barons and other Chief&nbsp; holders&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; nation</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Manorial Lordships.&nbsp; We&nbsp; now return to continue our account by Sir Winston Churchill&nbsp; who would&nbsp; mostly&nbsp; be unaware of these&nbsp; earlier Doomsday ( Roses)&nbsp; events, and their complex sequelae);&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; had meanwhile skipped&nbsp; in his coverage to the time of the Barons</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> Wars&nbsp; under King John and Henry III&nbsp; (</span><span class=rvts4>1215-1250</span><span class=rvts5>) (touched on above) and the subsequent reign of Edward I&nbsp; (ie ca </span><span class=rvts4>1265-1300s</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; By&nbsp; this time,&nbsp; the Lordship of the Somerset manor of Churchill&nbsp; (ex-Benwell) had long been seized by the Crown&nbsp; (during&nbsp; those conflicts of the </span><span class=rvts4>11-200s</span><span class=rvts5>) and likely given or sold to a local favourite </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as the Malets or, later, the Poyntz s.&nbsp; That latter families, later&nbsp; much reduced, may have&nbsp; held it&nbsp; through the&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1300s </span><span class=rvts5>and&nbsp; the Wars of the Roses </span><span class=rvts4>1400</span><span class=rvts5>s), with&nbsp; the Poyntz</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s at least, through&nbsp; the&nbsp; era&nbsp; of the Tudors</span><span class=rvts4> (1500s)</span><span class=rvts5>. </span></p>

In the early </span><span class=rvts4>1400</span><span class=rvts5>s, the then Duke of Bedford employed one </span><span class=rvts4>Richard Wydville)&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> as his Chamberlain,&nbsp; his father having been&nbsp; Sheriff of Nottingham.&nbsp; Richard</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s son, of same name, also entered the Duke</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s service in his turn </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> around </span><span class=rvts4>1425</span><span class=rvts5> .&nbsp; The Duke</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s first wife died shortly after this and he&nbsp; re-married in </span><span class=rvts4>1433,</span><span class=rvts5> at a mature age ,&nbsp; to a 17year old </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Jaquetta, a Duchess&nbsp; of Luxembourg</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of that small nation</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s royal family.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had no issue before he soon died&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1435</span><span class=rvts5>, leaving her a young and very wealthy widow, with no children.&nbsp; In such circumstances, she would require the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s permission as to whom she, as a Duchess,&nbsp; could re-marry.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she was apparently attracted to the younger&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>Richard Wydville</span><span class=rvts5>, then&nbsp; aged about 30;&nbsp; they soon married&nbsp; but without such permission, in </span><span class=rvts4>1437</span><span class=rvts5>, and were consequently fined £1000,&nbsp; but this was later rescinded.&nbsp; Through the </span><span class=rvts4>1440</span><span class=rvts5>s and </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>50</span><span class=rvts5>s they then had a large family of Wydville/ Wioodville children including&nbsp; 5 sons and 8 daughters; all would become increasingly influential in royal circles,&nbsp; their parents being&nbsp; worth £8000 a year (about a million or more).&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their eldest daughter E</span><span class=rvts4>lizabeth&nbsp; Wydville </span><span class=rvts5>(b</span><span class=rvts4> 1437</span><span class=rvts5>) would thus marry the monarch himself - Edward IV - n </span><span class=rvts4>1464</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; further consolidating her&nbsp; family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s wealth and influence, including that of her&nbsp; younger siblings </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> one of whom was&nbsp; a </span><span class=rvts4>Margaret Wydville</span><span class=rvts5> (b </span><span class=rvts4>1454</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; And her eldest brother </span><span class=rvts4>Anthony Wydville</span><span class=rvts5> was made an Earl, Lord Rivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Lancastrians sought to besmirch the now Yorkist Wydvilles, pointing out Richard</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s non-aristocratic&nbsp; background, and hence his and Anthony</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; various estates were often attacked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard&nbsp; and a younger son John became embroiled in the Battle of&nbsp; Edgecote&nbsp; Moor&nbsp;&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1469, </span><span class=rvts5>where they (as Yorkists)&nbsp; were defeated and both summarily executed.&nbsp; By</span><span class=rvts4> 1470/71</span><span class=rvts5>, Edward needed further support.</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard was thus succeeded,&nbsp; as 2</span><span class=rvts16>nd</span><span class=rvts5> Earl Rivers,&nbsp; by his eldest son </span><span class=rvts4>Anthony Wydville </span><span class=rvts5>(b ca </span><span class=rvts4>1439</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; He became&nbsp; known as a great Tournament champion and replaced his father&nbsp; as the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s frequent&nbsp;&nbsp; companion&nbsp; and protector.&nbsp; He appears to have married firstly, aged about 26 (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1465</span><span class=rvts5>),&nbsp; Elizabeth de Scales , daughter of Thomas de Scales, a Boron,.&nbsp; She died in </span><span class=rvts4>1473</span><span class=rvts5> without issue.&nbsp; He soon married 2ndly in about </span><span class=rvts4>1475</span><span class=rvts5>, Mary FitzLewis, daughter of a Henry Fitz Lewis - which union was also childless.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, he did have a mistress </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of long standing.</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around this period, King Edward had gone&nbsp; briefly&nbsp; into exile accompanied byAnthony Wydville (in </span><span class=rvts4>1470</span><span class=rvts5>) but&nbsp; they returned together the following year when&nbsp; Edward re-gained&nbsp; the throne. In </span><span class=rvts4>1472</span><span class=rvts5>, he&nbsp; sent Anthony and his younger brother Richard Wydville to aid the Bretons in Brittany&nbsp; with&nbsp; 1000 English Archers against the French, whom they defeated.&nbsp; Anthony he was then appointed&nbsp; Guardian of the Prince of Wales</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> household&nbsp; when they went to live at Ludlow Castle,&nbsp;&nbsp; he having&nbsp; previously been appointed&nbsp; High Sheriff for much of neighbouring Wales where, at sone earlier point,&nbsp; he would have met meet various persons of influence&nbsp; in that Principality </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> including no doubt one William Strandling, Sheriff of&nbsp; St Donat</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Cstle in Glamorgan,&nbsp;&nbsp; and thus his daughter Gwendline </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> whom he </span><span class=rvts8>seems</span><span class=rvts5> to have known&nbsp; sometime before that appointment.&nbsp; She in fact had become his mistress with whom he had an illegitimate daughter as early as </span><span class=rvts4>1455 </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> when they were both</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>rather&nbsp; young </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and&nbsp; rhus&nbsp; long before his 2 childless marriages.&nbsp;&nbsp; She would thus be his sole heir </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> on day.</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of Anthony</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; (and Elizabeth)</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s younger sisters,&nbsp; Margaret&nbsp; Wydville,&nbsp; had herself not long been born - to their father Richard Wydville and wife Jaquetta&nbsp; (in </span><span class=rvts4>1454</span><span class=rvts5>) and&nbsp; his own daughter Margaret&nbsp; appears to have been born and so maned&nbsp; shortly after this.&nbsp; There were thus 2 young Margaret Woodvilles&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; of very similar&nbsp; ages,&nbsp; growing up in the </span><span class=rvts4>1460</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> their common denominator being </span><span class=rvts4>Anthony Wydville</span><span class=rvts5> - the brother of one and the father of the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Illegitimate&nbsp; children wwere&nbsp; not uncommom in the upper classes in those days and while such sons of that status often acquired&nbsp; a surname prefixed by Fitz&nbsp; (from the French - Fils)&nbsp;&nbsp; of the father</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s </span><span class=rvts8>first</span><span class=rvts5> name, the daughters would typically&nbsp; take on his&nbsp; actual </span><span class=rvts8>surname</span><span class=rvts5>, rather&nbsp; than&nbsp; that of ther parents.&nbsp; As Anthony was to have no legitimate issue from either of his&nbsp; wives, young Margaret</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s future would&nbsp; thus be quite assured, not only by Anthony</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; status as an Earl,&nbsp; but&nbsp; by his close&nbsp; association with&nbsp; the King, and his own inherited wealth.&nbsp; Any&nbsp; potential&nbsp; future husband who supported the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s position&nbsp; (as Charles Churchill of Rockbeare, Esq)&nbsp; would quite&nbsp; reasonably expect such a marriage&nbsp; to be </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>financially attractive</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The future for Anthony</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s younger sister&nbsp; Margaret Wydville (b </span><span class=rvts4>1454</span><span class=rvts5>),&nbsp; was of course equally assured but at a&nbsp; more established social level; she would marry Thomas Fitzalan,&nbsp; 10</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> Earl Arundel, and have by him 4 children.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if the bride chosen for Charles had in fact been the latter Margaret instead and he soon died (as he did&nbsp; about&nbsp; a year later)&nbsp; would there have been any difference between the two in a&nbsp; tendency to suppress knowledge of any such brief first&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; issue ? </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For, when we seek evidence of that first marriage of Anyhony</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s daughter (of ca </span><span class=rvts4>1472)</span><span class=rvts5> , or of that od Eliz\abeth</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s young sister,we find&nbsp; in both cases ,that the young&nbsp; Margaret Wydvilles&nbsp; concerned are </span><span class=rvts4>both</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; subsequently shown as </span><span class=rvts8>only</span><span class=rvts5> marrying into the two respective aristocratic families&nbsp; described </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; to Sir Robert Poyntz in one case </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> vaguely implied as occurring&nbsp;&nbsp; around </span><span class=rvts4>1480 </span><span class=rvts5>or so </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>and&nbsp; to Lord</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> Thomas Fitzalan, albeit considerably&nbsp; earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1466;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>his</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>Margaret</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> being&nbsp;&nbsp; aged&nbsp; but 11 or 12 only - being&nbsp;&nbsp; her parents</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> 7</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> daughter, born in</span><span class=rvts4> 1454</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In neither case would such marriages be considered not to be the girls first .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The descriptions available indicate that she was the slightly older Margaret,&nbsp; with Sir Robert</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s bride, on the other hand,&nbsp; being&nbsp; clearly described as the&nbsp; illegitimate daughter of&nbsp; Anthony Wydville&nbsp; and Gwendolina&nbsp; Stridling rather than the recent widow of a Charles Churchill.&nbsp; That Margaret couldof course well have had a prior marriage therefore </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ca </span><span class=rvts4>1472</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> somewhere.&nbsp; But no reference to same is suggested whatsoever in the description of her later marriage.

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the King died suddently in early </span><span class=rvts4>1483,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; Elizabeth, the Queen&nbsp; (nee Woodville) ordered her brother Anthomy (Lord River)</span><span class=rvts4>,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> to bring&nbsp; the Primce of Wales, now King Edward V, straight&nbsp; back to London from Ludlow - under armed guard.&nbsp;&nbsp; This he immediately set out to do but they were&nbsp; soon intercepted by </span><span class=rvts4>Richard,&nbsp; Duke of Cloucester</span><span class=rvts5> (a fervent Lancastrian), who&nbsp; arrested them.&nbsp; Anthony wasthus imprisoned and later&nbsp; beheaded -&nbsp; in June </span><span class=rvts4>1483</span><span class=rvts5> - at Pontefract Castle;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard was seeking the Monarchy&nbsp; himself </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>to become&nbsp; a short reigning Richard III - before Henry Tudor</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s final victory </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in</span><span class=rvts4> 1487</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward V had reigned but briefly&nbsp; before being deposed by Richard and, with his young brother,&nbsp; were placed in the Tower and mysteriously </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>disappeared ( presumed murdered).&nbsp; Henry VII married Elizabeth (nee Wydville)</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s eldsest daughter </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Elizabeth of York</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - to help cement matters betweenYork and Lancaster and so finally end the Wars of the Roses.&nbsp; Both sides had virtually exhausted&nbsp; them salves and Henry picked up the pieces. </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, back in Rockbeare,&nbsp; Devon, Charles</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> assumed marrriage to</span><span class=rvts8> his</span><span class=rvts5> Margaret Wydville (she described by Coxe&nbsp; as a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Countess</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - wnich she may well have been - as the daughter of&nbsp; an Earl </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but they could easily confuse </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>which Earl</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; She&nbsp;&nbsp; was at least blessed by a son </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>Thomas Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in </span><span class=rvts4>1473</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> before Charles</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> untimely passing within a year or so. [ I have noted no other young widow described&nbsp; as appearing then&nbsp; in that situation.]&nbsp; What was young Margaret Churchill to do now ?&nbsp; In what position financially was&nbsp; she&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>and</span><span class=rvts5> her&nbsp; infant son&nbsp; Thomas Churchill&nbsp; left&nbsp; ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just where would any such information eventually be recorded and&nbsp; archived ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Not in that quoted in the Wikipedia&nbsp; article devoted to Margaret</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s next husband&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts4>Sir Robert Poyntz</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was a Lancastrian&nbsp; ssupporter of Henry Tudor&nbsp; -at least at the Battle of Bosworth in</span><span class=rvts4> 1485 </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>and quite probably before that.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>We may recall that Anthony Wydville was captured and executed in</span><span class=rvts4> 1483 </span><span class=rvts5>and was not available to oversee his daughter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s future after that date.&nbsp; But, between </span><span class=rvts4>14737</span><span class=rvts5> (when she was 12) and</span><span class=rvts4> 1483</span><span class=rvts5>, he certainly was available to so do. If Margaret did marry a Yorkist supporter (as Charles Churchill)&nbsp; after Earl Courtney, his Devon over -Lord, deserted that cause,&nbsp; it would without doubt be Anthony Wydvill, her father , who would have overseen such a promised union.&nbsp;&nbsp; He would not do so if her next marriage was&nbsp; with a family of the other side </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ie&nbsp; around </span><span class=rvts4>1576-1482</span><span class=rvts5>, say!&nbsp; Who would so arrange that marriage then or after ?&nbsp;&nbsp; It likely wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t in fact so arraged&nbsp; in the early </span><span class=rvts4>1470</span><span class=rvts5>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it only so arranged after </span><span class=rvts4>1482&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> therefore ?&nbsp; Yes, likely </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with the dates of marriage and consequent issue</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s birthdates&nbsp; somehow&nbsp; lacking or obscured.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the circumstances that then prevailed in those confused times near the end of the Wars of the Roses , there is thus </span><span class=rvts9>a parallel&nbsp; ambiguity</span><span class=rvts5> over the years</span><span class=rvts4> 1472</span><span class=rvts5> and </span><span class=rvts4>1482</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; about&nbsp; the events surrounding&nbsp; the life of </span><span class=rvts4>Margaret </span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Woodville</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5> (nee Stradling, ex-Churchill (possibly)&nbsp; - soon&nbsp; to become a Poyntz) -&nbsp;&nbsp; - during which time she was aged between 17&nbsp; and&nbsp; 27 </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> having possibly borne&nbsp; a child born </span><span class=rvts4>Thomas Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; near the start of&nbsp; period.&nbsp;&nbsp; For how long might he have&nbsp; remained&nbsp; with her </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and where ?&nbsp; As noted, this ambiguity also applies over the dates of birth of her subsequent&nbsp; Poyntz children,&nbsp;&nbsp; I have estimated that they were probably&nbsp; not born until&nbsp; the mid-</span><span class=rvts4>1480</span><span class=rvts5>s.&nbsp; By this time, young Charles Churchill would be about 10 or so and thus&nbsp; more suitable&nbsp; to be cared for by some close Churchill relative </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> back at Rockbeare.&nbsp; It is difficult to imagine that his parentage details were somehow invented by such as Coxe or Pole). </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet the historians who composed the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>facts</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; about Sir Robert Poyntz</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s subsequent marriage and issue conveniently show no reference whatsoever to his young bride having had any prior union.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor are any dates of his marriage or births of his later children given.

<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Addendum on the Parentage of Thomas Churchill (bn ca 1473) </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the year </span><span class=rvts4>1450</span><span class=rvts5>, a son </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> one </span><span class=rvts4>Robert Poyntz</span><span class=rvts5>, - was born into an established landed family long settled on a Manor estate about 10 miles north-east of Bristol on the Somerset border with Glousestershire.&nbsp;&nbsp; While Bristol was a very important commercial City, and Port, with many wealthy merchants in the import- export business trading with the Continent,&nbsp; those established landed families in estates nearby </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as the Berkelerys and the Poyntzs - continued during the Wars of the Roses to maintain their positions and status more by the security of their estates, their&nbsp; rental&nbsp; incomes&nbsp; and by good marriages&nbsp; than by concerns over how trade was being affected by the War.&nbsp; Of course, </span><span class=rvts13>who</span><span class=rvts5> one knew in&nbsp; the changing hierarchies holding royal power&nbsp; then remained very important to many as well.&nbsp; By </span><span class=rvts4>1470</span><span class=rvts5>, the above Robert Poyntz had likely not quite reached the age where he would&nbsp; begin to be overly concern himself with&nbsp; the current situation&nbsp;&nbsp; with the War, nor declare himself an active&nbsp; supporter of either&nbsp; faction. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another&nbsp; son </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>Chales Churchill </span><span class=rvts5>- was born just a little earlier - around </span><span class=rvts4>1445 </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> also i</span><span class=rvts5>nto an established landed&nbsp; family settled on a Manor estate </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> also about 10 miles north-east of another&nbsp; City,and Port, but a smaller one&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> that of Exeter, in Devon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, his family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s interests&nbsp; centred on their&nbsp; property and marriages, rather than trade, although&nbsp; there had been more set-backs in its viability than with the Poyntzs </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with that excess of earlier daughters over sons and many property&nbsp; losses&nbsp; through&nbsp; the dictates of former Sovereigns - as described elsewhere;&nbsp; their Esquire status&nbsp; was barely&nbsp; hanging on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; in&nbsp; that regard, the two families had, as they say, </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>history</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much earlier, the Churchills held a great many properties throughout Somerset, the county now lying between them. [It would be rather </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>poetic</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> if a particular one of those </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> namely&nbsp; Idstock (nr Curry Malet))&nbsp; proved to be about mid-way between the 2 family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s later respective seats </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> by ca</span><span class=rvts4> 1470</span><span class=rvts5>, say.&nbsp; For that was the one Somerset Manor that appears not to have accompanied&nbsp; the great majority of ex-Churchill holdings&nbsp; that wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t transferred&nbsp; quite so mysterious (being essentially unexplained) to the Malets -&nbsp; who must have supported some&nbsp; new King by about </span><span class=rvts4>11170,</span><span class=rvts5> say -&nbsp; 300 years earlier (!) but, rather, was transferred (just as surreptitiously ) from the Churchill to the Poyntz family.]&nbsp; Someone must have chosen the right King to support. Did this possibly repeat itself ?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By about </span><span class=rvts4>1470</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; the chief over-Lord in Devonshire&nbsp; - the County Earl, Thomas Courteney, decided to support the current King EdwardIV in his on-going struggles against&nbsp; the&nbsp; incessant provocations of the Lancastrian opposition.&nbsp; Courteney encouraged support from his county</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s nobles and lesser knights and Esqires.&nbsp; One of the latter who answered the call was shown to be </span><span class=rvts4>Charles Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> now of Rockneare, he then aged 25.&nbsp; [We may note in passing that Robert Poyntz was then about 20 and one reads nothing about him supporting one side or the other;&nbsp;&nbsp; had he have been 25 or so then, we may well have seen such references to him in this regard </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as we would more likely do&nbsp; in just a few years time.]&nbsp;&nbsp; But, by about </span><span class=rvts4>1472</span><span class=rvts5>, Courteney decided to switch or cease his allegiance.&nbsp; Charles&nbsp; was one of these Devon men who preferred to remain with Edward however and to this end he was apparently promised the reward of an arranged marriage with someone&nbsp; whose financial position and/or&nbsp; property would enhance his own then limited standing.&nbsp; This fact (as it appeared to be) was recorded in such as Coxe</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Churchill account and in Pole</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>slocal&nbsp; history of Devon&nbsp; in which it is clearly stated that Charles then married one </span><span class=rvts4>Margaret Wydville</span><span class=rvts5> in about </span><span class=rvts4>1473 </span><span class=rvts5>and with her have&nbsp; a son </span><span class=rvts4>Thomas Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ca </span><span class=rvts3>1474</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> before Charles sadly died shortly after </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> possibly fighting for the King..&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much continued contact did Margaret Churchill&nbsp; have with her young son Thomas between </span><span class=rvts4>1475</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts4>1485</span><span class=rvts5>, say ?&nbsp; And where ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out that Margaret was the illegitimate daughter&nbsp;&nbsp; of the mistress of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>Sir Anthony Woodville</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> one Gwndoline Stradling of Glamorgan in Wales.&nbsp; Anthony</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s sister Elizabeth Wydville had married&nbsp; King Edward who had found both her father Richard Wybville (1st&nbsp; Lord Rivers) and now&nbsp; his&nbsp; new brother-in-law. Anthomy (2</span><span class=rvts16>nd</span><span class=rvts5> Lord Rivers) very helpful and competent in protecting&nbsp; him in his precarious role&nbsp; as&nbsp; a Yorkist monarch.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wydvilles were very wealthy in their own right and even more so after their connections with the King.&nbsp; So any arranged marriages overseen by either Queen Elizabeth - for her many siblings,&nbsp; or any by Anthony - for&nbsp; his own&nbsp; issue&nbsp; (as with&nbsp; Charles Churchill) would thus be equally affordable and significant..&nbsp; As it turned out,&nbsp; both these Wydville siblings had a relative&nbsp; named and/or known as </span><span class=rvts4>Margaret Wydville</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> born&nbsp; only a year apart (</span><span class=rvts4>1454</span><span class=rvts5> and</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts4>55</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; The slightly elder girl was Elizabeth</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s much younger sister and the other Margaret was Anthony</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s daughter by Gwendoline, born slightly later. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point after the latter Margaret Wooodville</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; apparent husband Charles had died (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1474-</span><span class=rvts5>77) a second marriage for his new widow would eventually be arranged.&nbsp;&nbsp; Information about that would appear to have been presented to the world just as it had already been for her&nbsp; name-sake&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>aunt</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5> at her&nbsp;&nbsp; first and only marriage - likely arranged by&nbsp; Elizabeth </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> that is, as though it too was to be her first and only marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this point, young Robert Poyntz had become&nbsp; a little older and would likely become more obviously involved in the national struggle.&nbsp; Did he (or his father) see the family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s) interests best aligned with or against the King ?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very thorough analysis of the attitues displayed about then by his nearby City of Bristol merchants ca</span><span class=rvts4> 1466</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts4>1475+</span><span class=rvts5> (by the Bristol Historical Society ) sadly doesn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t mention that local family </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and it&nbsp; maddeningly stops a touch early for our chief focus.&nbsp; It doesn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t seem to conclude that Bristol (or its nearby major&nbsp; land-holding neighbours)&nbsp; were&nbsp; either mostly for, or against,&nbsp;&nbsp; the King.&nbsp; There thus&nbsp; appears no clear evidence that the Potyntz family supported either faction .prior to the&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1480s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>An article on Wikidedia on the latter family, does give&nbsp; an account on Sir Robert Poynt- of Iron Acton, the family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Manor near Bristol:&nbsp; He lived from </span><span class=rvts4>1450 </span><span class=rvts5>to</span><span class=rvts4> 1520 </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>giving the names of his parents and children&nbsp; and that of his wife.&nbsp; It doesn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t mention what side he or his father were on during the Wars of the Roses -&nbsp; except to note that he fought latterly at least for Henry Tujdor, the Lancastrian victor,</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>in</span><span class=rvts4> 1485</span><span class=rvts5> at Bosworth, and in </span><span class=rvts4>1487</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at the very&nbsp; end of those many Wars.&nbsp; We may point out that Yotkist Anthony Wydville had already been captured&nbsp; by the Lancastrians in </span><span class=rvts4>1483,</span><span class=rvts5> shortly after the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s death earlier that same year (of a stroke)&nbsp; with Anthony&nbsp; then executed at Pontefract forthwith </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> allegedly after writing his Will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Poyntz&nbsp; was said to be one of the Executors of Robert</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Will written just before he was beheaded.&nbsp; This seems rather odd.&nbsp; Did Anthony have no surviving Yorkist&nbsp; colleagues to serve this role ?&nbsp; What did he leave to his only heir </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Margaret;&nbsp; he had been a very wealthy man.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who dictated the instructions of the Will of a man about to be beheaded ?&nbsp; Who witnessed it </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a Lamcastrian ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Who benefitted ?&nbsp; Whom did Margaretthen&nbsp; marry….and&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts11>WHEN</span><span class=rvts5> ?&nbsp; We have alluded to this in our reference to the Wikipedia&nbsp; article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these two questions are conveniently answered - in both cases </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> from&nbsp; the same source: the article on Robert Poyntz.&nbsp; He was married, on an unknown date, to none other than </span><span class=rvts4>Magrgaret Woodville </span><span class=rvts5>(so identified)</span><span class=rvts4> ,</span><span class=rvts5> the</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>illegitimate daughter of Anthony Woodville, and&nbsp; subsequently had by Robert&nbsp; sevevral Poyntz children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their dates of birth, as her date of marriage,&nbsp; are not reported.</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> It may well have been that, suspiciously,&nbsp; they married only in or after </span><span class=rvts4>1483</span><span class=rvts5>, say.&nbsp; When and where had Margaret last live with&nbsp; her son Thomas (if she did) ? Margarert</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s marriage to Robert Poybyz is described solely as though it was her first and only one.&nbsp; Can we realistically accept that Coxe</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s and Pole</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s records were therefore&nbsp; entirely invented.&nbsp;&nbsp; ?&nbsp; Why bother to seek out such a fairy tale </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there no evidence pertaining to our principals for the years </span><span class=rvts4>1472 </span><span class=rvts5>to </span><span class=rvts4>1482,</span><span class=rvts5> say ??&nbsp; Why not ?&nbsp; This blank period should be more explicable. &nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps15><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One might reasonably assume that the above Thomas's </span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>  eldest son </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill (</span><span class=rvts5>born about </span><span class=rvts4>1518,</span><span class=rvts5>say,</span><span class=rvts4>) </span><span class=rvts5>would have automatically inherited the main property [Manor]&nbsp; in Rockbeare </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> which would have been legally confirmed earlier and&nbsp;&nbsp; so not be mentioned formally in the Will.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, it would presumably continue to be the seat of that&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>senior line</span><span class=rvts5> of the Churchill family per se </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> (being still in Devon).&nbsp; We can</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t be certain whether the name shown for his daughter <b>Beaton</b>) was her forename or possibly her married surname.&nbsp; It would be helpful (if it was a surname and there was a Beaton Will left by either her husband or her Beaton father-in-law.&nbsp; [Note: We later came across a Churchill daughter given this same name in 1604, born to a GEorge Churchill in Ottery St Mary nearby.  He would seem to be one of THomas's grandsons  born  about the 1570s.] </p>
<p> It seems odd that Thomas apparently had a son </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Robert</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> who wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t included in his list of assigns (sons)&nbsp; initially;&nbsp; should it therefore have actually read </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>George</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> instead (or even vice versa) ?&nbsp; (Robert could even have been&nbsp; a son-</span><span class=rvts9>in-law</span><span class=rvts5>, as they were often referred to as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>son</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> at the time,)&nbsp; We can appreciate the naming of a grandson as Charles Chyrchill , as that name was rather significant relatively recently in the family.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps15><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems quite possible that the name of the wife of Thomas (of the Will) was Iseult (often then&nbsp; pronounced as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Isote</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>) and likely spelt phonetically&nbsp; as such&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>but,</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; wrongly transcribed later as&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Ibote</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with&nbsp; the internal S of that name (often written in many words</span><span class=rvts13> then</span><span class=rvts5> in an exaggrated way - essentially as a long thin capital S </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> which was then wrongly transcribed as a small case&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>b</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> from the original Will or its abstract (when being typed).&nbsp; We may note that all the male forenames reflect names frequently seen both before and since within this Churchill families&nbsp; of Devon and Dorset [We think in particular of those found later in such as Muckleford (in Bradford Peverell), the Comptons and the Bredys </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> likely via the agency of a Bartlett; see later.]</span></p>
<p class=rvps15><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might reasonably conclude that,&nbsp; as Thomas&nbsp; then had at least two grandsons,&nbsp; he&nbsp; was quite possibly the homas we assumed to be bon&nbsp; about 1</span><span class=rvts4>494</span><span class=rvts5>, married by </span><span class=rvts4>1516</span><span class=rvts5>, had issue around </span><span class=rvts4>1518 to 1530, </span><span class=rvts5>say,</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> and grandchildren about </span><span class=rvts4>1545-60 - </span><span class=rvts5>before dying&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1577</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; He thus fits very well our above described elder son </span><span class=rvts4>ThomasChurchill</span><span class=rvts5> (Jnr) (with a wife Iseult),&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>and</span><span class=rvts5> with a younger brother </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>, born himself around </span><span class=rvts4>1496, </span><span class=rvts5>who would likely&nbsp; marry&nbsp; by ca </span><span class=rvts4>1518</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; The elder brother Thomas&nbsp; did indeed have issue as suggested </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> producing&nbsp; his own eldest son William&nbsp; (about </span><span class=rvts4>1518, </span><span class=rvts5>say) who, as Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s first cousin, would&nbsp; become&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>son and heir</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; of&nbsp; the still senior Rockbeare&nbsp; line and property&nbsp; - as of &nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1577</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; His eldest son in turn would likely be born in the </span><span class=rvts4>1560/70</span><span class=rvts5>s and inherit in his turn.&nbsp; There would&nbsp; thus still&nbsp; be 'Churchills&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of Roackbeare' </span><span class=rvts9>and area</span><span class=rvts10>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (and/or of Devon per se) into the </span><span class=rvts4>1600</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; presumably,&nbsp; including, I believe, one or two Clergymen named Peter Churchill).&nbsp; [W shall seek to better clarify these relationships in a subsequent pedigree. Their descendants appear to be those eventually noted in the Civil registrations of births, deaths and marriages in such as Ottery St Mary (Honiton Registration District) and/or Exeter - after </span><span class=rvts4>1837</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Moreover, some local church registrations became available from </span><span class=rvts4>1538 </span><span class=rvts5>and should provide further&nbsp; confirmation or leads to same. </p> 
<p> [We have recently discovered another Will which should help filll in sunsequent genertions.  It was written by a <b>George Churchill - of Rockbeare, Yeoman</b> - in <b>1659</b>, a year before his death there in <b>1660</b>.  In it, he makes reference to his wife Mary and  sons Thomas, William, George and Peter Churchill, leaving them bequests  of several Hundred Pounds in total. We would assume there would be at least two intervening generations  in Rockbeare  between Thomas (died <b>1577</b>) and this George (died <b>1660</b>) with his 4 sons  likely born ca  16330s-'40s.   We would hope to locate any <b>Church registrations, Taxation records, Militia lists and/or  Will references</b> eo assist us to this end.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may 'kill two birds with one stone' in this quest if we could integrate such knowledge  with that pertaing to the comparable two geneaions of the Sainthill family. They were briefly referred to above having eventually settled at Brad <b>pre-1500</b>, more to the South-east.  They seem to have subsequently held property in Rockbeare - long after the Churchills arrived there - but under what jurisdiction  seems  uncertain. The Churchills' status in this regard also becomes less certain after about <b>1600</b>. </p> 

<p><u><b>The CHURCHILLs and SAINTHILLs of ROCKBEARE.</b> </u></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already considered  the presence of the Churchills in Rockbeare as descended from  surviving third son <b>William Churchill</b> (ca <b>1375-1430)</b>  who had apparently settled there by ca <b>1400</b>, immediately next door, south of  their forner  Manor in Broadclyst. It appears that they already had some interests in Rockbeare - as Tenants-in Chief - after  purchasing its main Manor from the Bassets or the Fulfords (as we understand but the Abbey of Canonsleigh also held some of it then). The Churchills were still iving there after <b>1600.</b> But then, so were the Sainthills seemingly;  but, who actually owned what, and from when  ? </p>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unusual surname 'Sainthill' seems to have evolved from  an earlier Anglo-Saxon one - from before the Conquest -from a name such as 'Sweyne-atte-Hill', say, later becoming  such as Swayntill and eventually  Sainthill - by the mid-<b>1400s</b>. [One has noticed names such as 'John-ate-Wode' (Wood) gradually become  John 'Atwood',  or such as  'Harold-atte-Hil'  becoming Harold 'Athill' (often noted in Norfolk).]  Later, and less properly, 'Sainthill'  sometimes morphed into suach as 'Saint Hill' and even 'St. Hill' - with  their saintly connotations of rectitude and virtue. Later  possessors  (as Peter Sainthill 1) seem to have e felt  a need to reflect or at least adopt those implications. </p> 
 
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may obtain a clearer perspective on  the family if we  begin rather earlier - with the aid of a remarkably thorough account of them peblished in London in <b>1844</b> by a much later descendent - one <b>Richard Sainthil, RN</b>.  His book has  the rather unrevealing title of  <b>'Olla Podrida'</b>  which refers to a culinary concoction of many different meats and vegetables that remain after being boiled up together and the resulting 'soup' poured off. What's left is  said to be 'almost edible' and, only at the end of this lengthy discourse of the book's many topics does he detail for the reader the  recipe for the obscure dish of its title - with the hope they will find the book's contents a little  more palatable.</p> 
 
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To exemplify the book's  wiide range of contents, its first 100 or so pages are devoted entirely to an analysis of the silver coins minted in the <b>1600s</b> in Exeter.  By pages 290 to 350 or so, he then provide an account of his famiiy's history, if scattered in different sections,  after which  he also does so (rather more briefly) for that of the 'Aclands of Kilverton' (in the north of Broadclyst Hundred). This is possibly relevant in that his own family appears to have had its  early centre of gravity in neighbouring Honiton (and later in  <b> 'Clyst Honiton'</b> further weet - by the time of Edwwards II and III (ie during the<b>1300</b>s).</p>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence for this early location of his family is provided by scattered records of the early Parliaments.  Reprsentation of the English in Parliament, before about <b>1400</b>, was provided for  various main towns in different counties, or simply for the county itself.  We find that for Devon, a name that appears several times (for different Parliaments, under a given Monarch) was that of one <b>Walter Swaynthull</b> who was said to have resided near <b>Honiton</b> abd later in '<b>Clyst Honiton</b>', Devon.   Near the end of the regn of Esward II and throughout that of Edward III (ca <b>1330-1380</b>), <b>Walter Swayntill</b>, possibly a father and son,  represented Devon and/or Exeter in 7 or 8 different Parliaments.  The spelling of the name - crucially with the 2nd letter <u>always</u> being  a '<b>w</b>' - followed by  vowels 'a', 'e' , 'ay' or 'ey',  and  the final 3 letters typically  being  'till', 'hull' or 'hill'.  Before the Conquest,  we may recall that an earlier  Abglo-Saxon  leader  was King 'Cnut', whose father was  King Sweyne, after whom Cnut would nname  one son 'Swayne'.  Today. we have Swain and Sven; These were  all definitely not Norman ! But, by the later <b>1400</b>s, that previously invariable '<b>w</b>'  seems to have been purposely dropped - the name  even becoming 'Sayntall', at one point. That simple expedient seems to have shifted their confidence rowards peeomulgating a Norman descent.  </p>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are next told that  Walter's brother  Reginald  Swayntnill  held propery in the parish of  Aulscombe, called 'Wadhays',(as had their father and grandfather apparently) from the time of Edward 1st (ca 1270-307) or earlier -  as conveyed to them from Henery de Boteler (Harlein MSS 2410)  and that Walter later paid Subsidy Tax on it in <b>1323</b>. [A Devonshire Association article on Wadhays describes both Reginald and Walter as 'de Sweynthill' nand places  its location 2 miles norh-west  of Honiton (see www.devonassoc.org.uk and link to Wadhhays).  Their ancestors had thus come south - from a hamlet or farm in Kentisbeare called Swayntill or similar (and later, as Ssinthill, it still exists today). [I fiknd it very difficult to account fot its evolution from that earlier Sazon form, or similar, to its present form; one wonders when that 'w' was dropped. and by whom ?]    Walter  had a daughter 'Joane' who married  William de Heaton of 'Old Port' to whom Wadnays was later conveyed (or inherited?) (ca <b>1350</b>?) and so was left in turn to their daughter, also Joane, and future husband Richard Smaister (by about <b>1380</b>,  say), and then passed lineally to  one Linpenny who sold it to a William Hurst of Exeter  around <b>1425</b>, and thece to a William Bodley, seemingly also of Exeter (this also from 'de la Pole's 'Devon'). </p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspJust why this subsequent information is included is not made apparent. It may have implied that any unrecorded son of Walter (I've seen a William suggested) settled on a diffrent property that  wasn't so well recorded as that of Wadhays. The line appears next to become re-esablished thereby further south, near Bovey Tracy, just beyond Exeter - quite possibly on property owned by the Courtenays, Earls of Devon, who dominated ownership thereabouts - only renting it ouit on  Leasehold or Copyhold basis. That Wadhays itself was later acquired by one William Hurst of Exeter possibly indicates the family still had connections there which, we recall, Walter  represented in Parliament some generations before. He ws  said to be  "well learned in the law" and so had liklely been  educated  in a Grammar Schol, or higher, associated with Exeyer  Cathedral.  We might usefully note that if Walter and his brother had come from a small family manor after which they and their ancestors  were named (as located in Kentsbeare to the north, beyond Collompton), their futures (and hopefully that of some unrecrded male descendants) may well have <i>continued south</i> towards that major ciy, possiby via Clyst Honiton, which  was at least closer to  Exeter than  Honiton or Aulscombe. One can't imagine the younger generations reversing their progress south to the City,  to return to that earlier hamlet in Krntisbeare in the north.</p> 
 
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our next useful finding in this regard (not known by our later Richard Sainthill RN  in <b>1844</b>) was a reference in the Narional Archives to 2 or 3 legal cases dated ca <b>1490</b>s.  One was C1/142/74  between a John Hake and his then wife Jhone (nee Maayne) as Plaintiffs, and John Seynthill, father of Richard Seynthill, late first husband of said Jhone, as Defendants, regarding Money promised to Jhone but not received, on her earlier marriage to said Richard Seynthill. The case produced 5 documents the dates for which apparently range from <b>1486 to 1515</b>.  There is also a record in the Devon Record Office (D1/508M/Koger/240) in respect of property in the Manor of South Teign in North Bovey parish conveyed to a John Flavell, possibly dated 26 Jan 1516. [I have not yet seen these documents.] Also relevant was an earlier case (C1/96/89) dated  <b>1486 to 1493</b> wherein John Seynthill, Richard's said father,  was said to then be  <b>'of Moreton'</b> (now Morton Hampsted) which conerned  properties in 'A....ton' and  'South Teign' in North Bovey, was supposed to be settled on Jhone at her first marriage (to Richard) -  which may have ended in  divorce when they wereen't forthcoming. [I note  another case, C1//28/33, with  reference to Honiton and/or Aulscomce and  to John Seythill.  A John-atte-Wode (Wood) was also mentioned;  Wode/Wood  could become  'Woodland'  or  'Woodbury', both nearby in south Devon today].]</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While our author did not know of the existence of such documents, nor their contents (as Moretonhampsted) , he did know of another frequntly  suggested location  of the marriage aof his namesake ancestor Richard Sainthill to Jhone Mayne in which. oddly, such as North Bovey and Moreton Hampstead are <u>never</u> mentioned. In this quite alternate view, the Richard who married Jhone Mayne of Exeter (where thry lilrely married), is shown insead as being 'of Sainthill' (formerly Swayn-at-hill ?),that  hamlet or farm in  Kentisbeare,  some 14 miles <u>north-east</u> of Exeter, and thus not one 8 miles or less <u>south-west</u> of  same - with  Bovey, Teign and Moreton all nearby. Quite a difference.  He also knew that from Peter, Richard's  elder son, descended the senior line of the later Sainthills and from his second son, Edward, the junior branch likewise (of which he was then himself the main descendant; the senior branch  having  died out in the male line about a century before he was born).  Much attention was paid by historians to that senior line and just where it originated and/or  settled, and what it may have accomplished. [I 'feel' (no more than that) that said Peter, once settled at Bradninch, heard about that  hamlet in nearby Kentisbeare (quite coincidentally) and promoted the idea that it was the origin of his family <u>and</u> thus somehow associated wuith Bradninch from much earlier tim (there being however  absolutely no basis for this idea; there was no  convenient 'drift' westward by 'de Swaytills' into that early Cornish Barony). One will leave it at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much less attention was paid to the junior line, however.  Because of this disparity, we were ourselves seduced along that senior line firstly and thus, as said Peter Sainthill had moved into London-based activites centred on MIddle Temple and 'legal Lomdon, including some education at that Inn of Court (which seems not to hav been completed; (he History places a  ? before its Middle Temple reference in his case), he had nevertheless made some influential contacts there, including help in getting an obscure  west-country seat to contest as an MP.  It was for that reason that we were at least  able to take advantage of the much more organised and trustworthy facility (now online) called the' 'History of Parliament'  than was avialble in Rchard Sainthil's day (in Victorian times).  </p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Sainthill did gain his seat in that pbscure Cornish oconstituency (of Grampound, only recntly t enfranchised to warrent 2 members; later to be referred to as  one of the 'Rotten Boroughs).  So there wwas indeed an entry for him in the said History. But its information  turns out not to be consistent with the  view promoted by  his later family (and various Devon 'Sources') with respect to their  more northerly (Bradninch (and area) origins.  We may thus quote and paraphrase the HIstory's entry : </p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Peter Sainthill was born before <b>1514</b>, son of Richard Sainthill of <b> Moreton Hampstead</b>, Gent, by Jhoane, daughter of Richard Mayne of Exeter. Richard Sainthil died  9 Dec <b>1525</b>. Peter  was possibly educated (after Grammar School in Exeter?) at ?Middle Temple, an Inn of Court  in London and eventually married (firstly) on 26 Nov <b>1552</b>,aged about 40, Catherine, daughter of Sir Humphrey Browne (of that Inn), she the widow ofa Richard Townesend (who died <b>1551</b>, without issue),  and (secondly), ca <b>1558</b>) Juliana, daughter of William Shine of Bradley, Berkshire (she too having  married before, twice).  They had 2 sons and a daughter."  We will consider other aspects of elder brother Peter Sainthill's  career and such issue after first consolidating and clarifying our understanding  about the origin of his father's  family - apparently in the Moreton Hampstead - Bovey Tracy area in south-west Devon (around <b> 1460-1490</b>)- this location  having nothing whatsoever to do with Peter's <b>eventual</b> residence at more northernr Bradninch - in the <b>1550-60s</b>s.   This will  be discussed  later - afte considering the family's quite different and more likely origins,  as well as the junior line descended from second son Edward Sainthill (born by ca <b>1518</b>, say).  </p>
 
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw above that Richard's father was a John Saynthill when involved in litigation in the <b>1480-90s</b>.  Conveniently, we find that one website shows this man's family to have been of  North Teign, and Bovey.  A John Saynthill (born South Teign ca <b>1450</b>)  and wife Joane Wyke, appear thereby to have married around <b>1470-80</b>(as estimated) and had issue in North Bovey -  including  Richard Sainthill ca <b>1480</b> who seems to have settled later in Moreton Hampstead some miles inland nearer Dartmoor.   John himself is shown as born to a Walter Seynthill around <b>1425</b> (with said  Walter possibly born to an earlier  William of that line (who may have  named hWalter  after the earlir MP).   We have no data on wwho of the family first appeared in this  region south-ewest of Exeter - mostly ownwed by the Courtenays (Earls of Devon), from the 1250s. We should get a better picture of the events affecting Richard Saunthill's marriage and property around the years <b>1500+</b> (before his apparent early death in <b>1525</b>) - once we can examine that litgation with the man who seems to have married as his first wife Jhone/Joane Sainthill (nee Mayne).</b>. 
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard Sainthil RN  ubnderstood he descended from the junior  branch of the family - ie from  Eddward, second son of that earlier Richard Sainthill.  Edward was somehow settled in Rockbeare - from an unknown date and in an unknown property there.   But Richard could find no confirning evidence about this.  Fortunately, he was eventually  asissted in this by one John  Putman, Esq,  of the College of Arms, in <b>1827</b>, who held the College's position of 'Portcullis'. He produced  a useful pedigree which showed that Edward Sainthill married  Elizabeth Yarde, daughter of ohn Yarde  of a landed family of Honiton  by about <b>1545</b>. [We note that this date is about when many ex-Monestery properties were coming onto the market.] They had a son Richard, likely named after Edward's father, around <b>1550</b> and he in turn married, as 'Richard Sainthill of Rockbeare, Gent', to  'Ffyda Harlowing of Sidmouth, Genntlewoman'  and did so in Rockbeare in  <b>1592</b>;  this is only known (despite Rockbeare's  arly registers having been destroyed or lost) by virtue of the marriage having also been recorded in the register of  Sidmouth's  church because Fryda was of an important local family there.  This proves most fortuitous in that we learn thereby that the Sainthills of Rockbeare were not themselves Esquires of Rockbeare, but Gents only (as would be their parents and children presumably, thus indicating they held only Lease- or Gopy-hold property tnhere (if indeed they held any).  [However, it is possible that it would only be Peter 1 who was able (could afford) to buy Free- or Lease-hold ex-Monestery (Canonsleigh Abbey) property - if some time earlier (ca 1550-60, say).] Richard and Fryda had an elder  son Francis Sainthill in Rockbeare about <b>1595</b> who  married Susanna Pyne of Wimple (a neighbouring parish just to the east) by about <b>1620</b> and had a son Nicholas Sainthill ca <b> 1625</b>. </p>
  
   <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may note here that it would be around this time (ca <b>1625-35</b>) that George Churchill (possibly a son of a Thomas Churchill Jnr, Thomas Snr being he of the 1577 Will) would likely also  marry loccally and soom have his 4 sons ca <b>1635-45,</b>, as referred to in his <b>1659</b> Will, then  seeming adults.  Francis Sainthill died quite young (ca <b>1640</b> as estimated) and his son Nicholas (then about 16) decided to seek  employment - as a Mariner - sailing ouut of Topsham, near Sidmouth, where he  would settle with his own family after marrying late  (ca <b>1673</b>) 'Elizabeth Weber of Exeter, Spinster'.  George's 4 sons,  if a little younger than said Nicholas,  would probably all know him as he left for Topsham to become a Mariner,  as they  would liater knmow his progeny as well - son John (<b>1676-1730</b>) and  grandson, also John (bn <b>1703</b>),  both Mariners of Tposham in their time.   In George Churchill's reent Will, he left eldest son Thomas just  Fve Pounds - probably because he would also inherit the Leaehold of the family property (as well as benefittng in other respects (see below);  Next son George Jnr was left  One Hundred Pounds (50 Pounds of which represented money owed to George Snr); third son Peter also received One Hundred Pounds, from which £50 was to be paid to a Johan Orchard(?) of Bradnynch, Widow,  to whom he was somehow Bound so to do (she possibly being his sister), and to 4th and youngest son Ambrose Churchill, he also left One Hundred Pounds.  He had two daughters, Mary and Johan, ro whom he left Five Pounds apiece and several grandchildreen (unnamed) would receive Twentie Shillings each .Their existence indicates that their parents were likely born around <b>1625-35</b> and msarried in the 1650s, say. They would thus be contemporaries of Winston Churchill and his son John (born <b>1650</b>), of neighbouring Dorset.     </p>
  
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IThe Sainthills thus ceased being residents of  Rockbeare as a viable family there from around that time <b>1650-60</b> (the lattter year being when George Churchill died there) and  my earlier awareness that the last Sainthill there, described as the  'late Mrs Sainthill',  was finally  identified - as   'Susanna Sainthill (nee  Pyne), widow of Francis and mother of Nicholas.   Their  relationship, if any, with the 'Churchills of Rockbeare' had confused me - having never come across that surname before and wondering if it had in fact been  a  mistake for 'Churchill'. It wasn't (as I now appreciate). They  seem  to have died out there around <b>1650</b> thus ending the junior line of the 'Sainthills - that of Rockbeare' (said by one source (Historic England) to have 'acquired Rockbeare from Canonsleigh Abbey at the time of the Reformation' - a rather ambiguous period  by which to place an event; it was likely in about <b>1550</b>. After about a  centuury there, theey continued  in a sense at nearby Topsham - as Mariners (not Manor owners), until the time of our author - during  Victoria's reign. However,  according to national defence needs, Merchant Mariners, especially its Officers,  were often  required to transfer to the Naval service and the next two Sainthills in the descent opted for this latter route (as did the younger sons of the Gentry ('Gents') generally in those days, often  from the age of 12, since it typically led  to senior Naval Officer standing, being  equivalent to Esq status, something highly sought then and not otherwise attainable by maany.   Our author would have this ranking (as did his fsther who had  displayed heroic bravery in his day).  Subsequently, various cousins and nephews gradually spread the name Sainthill  into many other occupations and regions.</p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We may continue with George Curchill Snr's Will of <b>1660</b>:  He states next that 'Whereas I hace recently pruchased two 'Reversions' situated in Rockbeare (that is, properties  he bought that would revert to him only when the former owner(s) died) - the first, called 'Ford',  on the death of a Clement Perryman and the other after the death of Michael Fillimore, called 'West Parke', which (latter} said Reversion and Tenement I made my  sonne Thomas Purchasor thereof,  as by its Deeds doth and may appeare, And whereas I have also Bound n my son Thomas - to myself,  my Executor and my Assigns  in a Bond of Three Hundred Pounds which requires him to 'Devise, Assign, Grant and Sell On his interest and rights to such Estste  unto Ambrose my sonne - as by the  said Bond apeareth. And now my Will and Desire is that if my sonne Ambrose do Marry  and hereafter do procure and  settle himself in a convenient estae elsewhere, then my Will is that Thomas shall well and truly pay Ambrose Two Hundred ans Fiftie Pounds and then he and his Executor and asstgns may have and enjoy the said Reversion and Tenement aforesaid.  Item - All resdue of my Goodes, etc I do bequeathee to Mary my wife whom I make my sole Executor  And I appoint and charge my sonnes Fhomas, George and Peter to aid and assist their Motherr in the best manner they can to see my Will thus performed.   Signed:  Geo: Churchill   Wirmessed by a 'Wolliam Sottle'.  The Will was proved in London  on 7 Novemnber <b>1660</b> (the year the Monarchy was re-stored). We find that the value of money in the mid-1600s was about 1000 times what it is today.  George Churchill's estate was thus worth about $100,000 in today's money. If it had been Freehold in his father's day, say, and he had a similar family (with 3 to 5 sons), he may well have been forced to sell  by about the  1630s in order to set them up on their own smaller proberties.  George was in a similar situation, if now as a Yeoman,  and was just about abole to provide his sons with adequate means to afford their own, if smaller, properties, possibly with some help from the perents of their respective brides in this same social level. The recent Civil wat had left manny families less secure. Youngest son Ambrose was probably still too young to marry (at ca 16-17, say, and so born around <b>1642</b>).  We may reasonably eatinate the eldest Thomas son was thus about 10 or 12 years older. </p>      

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our original concern had been to discover which Sainthills had lived in Rockbeare and whether they co-existed there with the senior branch of Churchills after ca <b>1520</b> or so -  when the latter family's junior branch began to  migrate towards  Dorset.  If so, they would certainly have known each other and may have shared documentation that could help reveal the identities nand dates  of their various respective menbers. Sadly, we are now aware that the crucial church registers for Rocckbeare are lacking for most of the period of concern.   It would now appear that the status of the 'Sainthills of Rockbeare'  was that of haaving acquired (ytpically for a small cost) the 'manor  of <u>'the local church'</u> only of that parish (as previously held seemingly by the Abbey before <b>1545)</b>  which would generate a rather small income - as collector (but not recipient) of such  annual Tythes. Such 'sub-manors' became established for  many churches when the Freehold owners of the main Manor in such a Parish were some distant Abbey or absentee Landowner.  The latter's income from the Manor per se was that of the much greater rents paid by the Copyholders (or Leaseholders) of its  many farms.  They  would also control tthe  advowons for the Church incumbent. Who would be responsible for the  absence of so many years of the registers we cannot say. Are the records of the main Manor of Rockbeare still extant, one womders  ?  Who holds them ?  Later holders include the Duntze and Porter families in the 17th and 18th centuries. Did they retain all their prior Lease histories ?  </p>

<p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can see now that the overlap of the presence of both Sainthills and Churchills in Rockbeare would cover roughly the years <b>14545 to 1660</b> or so.  That is, from the arrival of Edward (and/or Peter 1) Sainthill  until the move by Nicholas Sainthill to Topsham.  The Churchills had arrived much earlier, around <b>1400+</b>, and appeared to stil be there, or nearby, after the <b>1670s</b> but in what capaciy is difficult  to determine. Information on wnen and who were born and/or  married to whom, or died, is lacking over much of this period - for both families. Wills and litgation records provide the only  likely  sources  although Taxs and MMilitia lists may provide some. We can see that the two families were both in Rockbeare during the Civil War period (ca <b>1640s</b> and during the following decade of the Commonwealth.)  Any such information, from those sources, if and when discovered, will hopefully be added here: </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Meanwhile, here are a few records from the National Archives that  pertain to Litigations between members of George Churchill's family (as himself, Peter, Ambrose and Thomas sand various  locals in Rockbeare or Otterey St Mary.  We place theeir reference numbers in chronological order (years shown  in bracketts):<br>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C7/264/44 (1607); C5/399/75 (1613; C2/ Jas1/C15/65 (1623-1625); C6/24/105 (1636); C10/27/64 (1654);C10/473/48 (1663); C10/156/87 (1670); C8/203/34 (1676); C10/411/31 (1681); DRO 3839M//T11(1682); C10/539/8 (1687); ADM 106/482/329 and/330 (1696); C10/413/80 (1698); E134/4Geo 1/Mich 3(1718) and M/ich 4 (1719) - when Rev Peter Churchill was Rector of Shobroke parish of which the litigation concerns; abd, finally, DRO 6071Z/F//2 (1732). None of these are currently available on-line, as they haven't been digitised (unlike PCC Wills). </p>      

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile,to complete our coverage of the Sainthill family, if rather more condensed, we consider finally  their so-called Senior line - as descended from  elder brother Peter Sainthill 1 (born ca  <b>1512</b>, say).  He likely arrioved in London around ca <b>1535-40</b>, as estimated. As with his younger brother Edward, we are not aware with what family they grew-up during  the <b>1520s-'30</b>s  and thus how their immediate ffutures  were influenced and determined.   The litigation documents involving their mother Jhone may reveal some things, recalling that their father Richard had apparently died as early as <b>1525</b> and their psrents may have divorced. Somehow, Peter got to London and maybe entered Middle Temple by  <b>1538</b> while  Edward and his young wife settled in Rockbeare - having acquired a role in respect of the 'manor' - possbly of the church there with its presumably modest 'living' (as collector of its Tythes; a kind of ''sub-Steward'. We womder if Richard's fther John may have had any suuch influence in arranging both these initial placements for his grandsons ?  Unless, it followed from the sale of some relevant property  there when the MOnesteries were dissolved (see later).  In any case, we at least kdiscover various items of nterest from the History of Parliament entry for Peter Sainthill. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard for us to appreciate the degree to which 'yuoug-Gents-about-town' anticipated maturity in earlier times.  With various  young lawyers as friends, Peter would no doubt take advantage of any promising possibilities that so presented themselves. The History shows that after possibly attending Middle Temple, he evetually married, firstly, in <b>1552</b> Cartherine, daughter of  one Sir Humphrey Browne, an emmminent judge of the day.  How this came about and was delayed until he was aged about 40, after 15 years in London, making such legal and political contacts (ca <b>1535-50</b>, say) is  rather difficult to justify. But, we may recall that this was a period of great flux in royal, governmental and public circles. The Dissolution of the Monesteries ca <b>1535-45</b>s  suddenly freed up the availability of quality property at suspiciously low prices- if one knew the right  people (as Robert Bartelot, Sir William Petre and Sir John Tregonwell) - ie in Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, respectively.  Peter Sainthill seems to have known them all !  According to the entry in the Pariamenrtry History covering Peter's biography, he had indeed "bought former Monestery properties to the tune of £600...." an enormous anmount in today's terms. Where did a man with his rather modest bakground get this sum ?  His father had died young, his mother had re-married (apparently before her first husband's death -  after a divorce) - implying mmoney  problems;  he would thus have little or no money after leaviing his assumed Grammar School, ikely in Exeter, around <b>1525</b> or so.</p>
 
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The History does refer to a small property [Leaseheld?] he may have inherited in Moreton Hampstead earlier which, if sold and with the capital raised (including some borrowings; his family  still wed moneylenders in London significant sums after the War) osed to  purchse a number of other smaller  ex-monestery properties (also mentioned in the History), effectively at a discount, then re-selling them at profit,  he could more understandably then afford that major purchase such as  at Bradninch and/or Rockbeare (held previously by yhe Abbey of Canonsleigh)  which itself had been purchased by about 1540 by one Richard Grenville - a  Cornwall MP (with a prtner) for £1170. The institution 'Historic England' is quoted as noting that Rockbeare, amongst hundreds, was held (from the Conquest) by the Bishop of Bath and Wells who gave it to Matilda,  Countess of Gloucester, who later gave it to Canonsleigh Abbey on its foundation about <b>1284</b>.  Itappears that this Abbey  was suppressed from ca <b>1536</b> during the Dissolution of the Monesteries by Henry VIII's Agents (as Tregonwell and Bartlett)and soon sold on to Richard  Grenville (of an influential Cornish family) and partner <b>before</b> the Sainthills acquired it or whatever part of it Grenville wished to sell on. Alternatively, Peter Sainthill may have used most of his money to re-build Bradninch House  (as described later) around <b>1545-50</b>. It was a former 'Barony' still held by the Duchy of Cornwall with quite possibly various Deputy positions required by its absentee Lanlord - to help run it.  Peter would no doubt have heard about tbth of these possibilities when repreaenting his small Cornish constituency.  </p>  
 
 <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also refers to him applying for a Coat of Arms about then (ca <b>1546</b>) based it seemed solely on his exagerated self-description of his virtue and honour, which was somehow successful although the History  pointed out that such virtue wasn't its own reward in his case compared with that soon gained by his ex-Monestery profits.  As his position improved, he somehow acquired a role pertining to the Admiralty and when stationed nar Poole in Dorset had occasion to write to  Admiral Edward Seymour (related to Jane Seymour, ex-Queen)  pointing out to him that a Ship had gone aground on the Isle of Wight nearby, and signing himself 'your assured friend'. The significance of this is not made explicit but they do point out that Admiral Seymour, known for having enriched himself through such 'found treasure', and his brother,  both subsequently 'disappeared' (in fact executed, I beleve,  ca <b>1550</b>).   In any case, that new 'rotten Borough' in  Cornwall (Grampound) had recently been enfranchised  and required its second MP, the choice of Peter Sainthill being accounted for  by virtue of his friendship with  Admiral Seymour; he was thus returned for same in <b>1547</b>.  [Those returned for most seats then generally had such influential backers or had close ties with the area;  Peter had no connections then in Cornwall.  However, he soon would have - ain the form of  another  local MP who happened to be  the Chancellor of the Duchy of Cornwall) - an influential Lawyer-cum-Treasurer  with a Middle Temple background.</p>
 <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would seem to be only then when Peter heard about something called the <u>Duchy's</u> borough of Bradninch (an ex-Cornish Barony, albeit situated just beyond Cornwall) - in neighbouring Devon.  Like Roakbeare, with its often absentee landlord, it required a Steward or even Sub-steward, to look after the responsibilites of the Church there  (as collecting  its Tythes, etc). The Freehold for the Manor per se was of course held by the Duchy (in perpetuity) and thus  the Stewrd would typically be a 'Genleman' (not an Esq  holding his own Freehold estate). But, there was a large  House  there that needed re-nuilding. Peter soon moved in - and re-built it.  2 or 3 yeras later, Middle Temple's renown Judge, Sir Hemphrey Browne's daughter Katherine's first husbsnd had died and in <b>1552</b>, she re-married - yo Peter Sainthill whose prospects had recently improved. He was then 40.  He may have stood at the next election in <b>1553</b> but declied or avoided seeking such influence (since it  might be a  reflection on his father-in-law who  had stood  security for an MP who was in dis-favour and so ran successfully instead for another Cornish seat a year later - a small port near Plynouth). His first wife had recently died  without issue and he re-married in <b>1560</b> - a Juliana Shine (a widow who had  married twice  before)  with whom he finally had 2 sons and a daughter in the <b>1560</b>s - a little before Peter was  declared Insane, in <b>1566</b, in which condition he died in <b>1571</b> (at Bradninch).  </p>  
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter's elder son, Peter 2,was born in Bradninch in <b>1561</b> where he would no doubt inherit his father's roles  with the church and/or the Barony there, collecting the Tythes (but not the Manor's rents which of course went to the Duchy, the  Freehold owners (in perpetuity) - to pdrovide income for the Prince of Wales  (just as today), as part of the latter's income. As his fatther Peter 1 was becoming ill during his childhood, and died when he was still onlnly 10, there may  have been some oversight by uncles (and his mother) for himself and his younger boether during  the late 1560s/early 1570s.   After education   at Middle Temple in the <b>1580</b>s, he would marry Elizabeth Martin  ca <b>1590</b>  and have several children, including a Peter Sainthill (3) in <b>1593</b>, well known later in the fsmily as 'the Cavalier'.  Peter 2 would also not survive his sons' youth by much, dying in <b>1618</b>.  His  eldest son,  Peter Sainthill 3, 'the Cavalier',  would   fight  on the Royalist side in the coming Civil War - ca <b>1643-'46</b> - just as  John Churchill (<b>1593-1659</b>) and his son Winston (<<b>1620-1688</b>) would also do.  Like the  former, rhey  too had to pay their Fines for being on the losing side). But, unlike the Churchills, Peter first sought refuge in Italy, in <b>1646</b>, after the surrender by the Royalists in  Exeter, having first written an account of his estate and debts on which his Fines would be later calculated and  paid - by his son and heir <b>Samuel Sainthll</b> - by ca <b>1652</b>.   
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter 3 had been  elected an MP (for Tiverton) in both the  'Short' and 'Long' Parliaments, held in April and November  that year. Once Cromwell had gained power, ca <b>1643</b>, Peter was disbarred from holding any further Office of State. His support of the KIng continued however, through <b>1644/45</b> when he provided him with a night's  hospitality at Bradninch in July <b>1644</b> and Camping facilities for his Army in Sept <b>1645</b> before their last stand in Exeter where  General Fairfax  surrendered in Apr <b>1646</b>. Peter had already left for Italy with a Pass provided by Fairfax. Once in Legorno, he soon contracted a serious illness and died there in<b>1548</b>.  His unmarried son and heir Samuel  moved in to the (still Leased?) House in Bradninch.and seemed to assume an Esq status forhwith,  but I have no objective evidence of its justification or not.  [One has more recently appreciated that  since the 1600s (and probably for some time before), the stylimg - as Yeoman, Gentleman or Esquire - signifying levels of society below that of Knight in the Feudal system ca <b>1100 to 1500</b>, was based on rather more than just property ownership (vs renting).  Moreover, it was increasingly determined by social convention with no mandatory or legal basis ultimately, so was inceasingly adopted simply as <i>appeared fitting</i> - amongst one's peers; no more and no less.]      </p>
 
<p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A diary was kept by Peter 3, and was continued by his son Smuel, relating to the family's capital and debts on whhich basis they were to be Fined accordingly - by the the Commonwealth  Parliament.   It was to equal one third of its net value.  This seemed to have been eventually settled by Samuel wno would likely have sold off elements of property, possibly acquired by his father or grandfather  from their ex-monestery holdings and borrowings.   But Samhel remained unmarried and without issue,  so by his Will (<b>1708</b>) he initially intended to leave the estate Of still unknown property holdings, if any) to his neaarest relative (of the junior Rockbeare branch) but, falling out with the latter cousin , left it instead to another relatve, his nephew, Edward Yarde of Treasbeare (<b>1637-1732</b>), the unmarried son of his sister Dorothy and  Thomas Yarde, then  71.  Edward  subsequently married, changed his surname to 'Sainthill' (by Act of Parliament), and had a son (ca <b>1712</b>)  and lived to 95 ! The son (seemingly an Edward) married (ca <b>1740</b>) and left as his heiress, an Elizabeth Saithill (bn <b>1745</b>),  who married (ca 1765) a Rear Admiral Thomas Pearse (<b>1749-1820</b>)  whose son George (<b>1790-1851</b>) married a lady fom Jamaica, a wealthy plantation and slave owner.  These latter Sainthills and then Pearses were all 'of Bradninch House', in their day. A List of Freeholders in Devon (as per 1733) included one Edward Sainthill - 'of Bradninch, Esq' (!). The only other Devon Freeholder of this surname about then (1751) was a John Sainthill, Mariner - of the junior branch  in Topsham. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanuel makes just two Churchill references when reporting the family's estate  accounts, including  Rckbeare,  as an extension of his  father's searlier entries; that is, during the  mid-<b>1600</b>s.  One entry  implies that after Peter 3's beother Edward Sainthill's  line  left Rockbeare, to settle in Toppsham,  Samuel  must have stepped in on Nicholas's departure to continue  as Collector of  Tythes, etc  for the Rectory (or Vicarage?)  there  for he mentions receiving a small payment for same from one 'Churchill' [with no date shown] and, sadly, also  no  forename; it could well have been George. On the other occasion, he mentions  this 'Churchill' from whom he then actually  borrows some funds  - "to allow me  to pay  certain expenses" for which  he seems not to have had  the  ready cash. These account records were included in Ricahard Sainthill's much later book on the family.  It seems posible that the Sainhill's connection with Rockbeare may have been more than Samuel simply stepping in to continue Nicholas's role regading the Church  only (as Edward and his direct descendants seem to have done from about <b>1550</b>).For they may have done  as Leaseholders under Edward's elder brother Peter (a la 'primogeniture'). For we have located a Will for 'Peter Sainthil of Bradninch, Esq' (Wr. <b>1647</b> in Legorno and Pr. <b>1653</b>) in london - by his brother Robert (who had already resided in Legorno for some time, as a Merchant, being  younger than Samuel , I believe). In it, he refers twice to Rockbeare (almost as much as to Bradninch), if in some  indecipherable context which  one shall, in time, seek to interpret. It could rhelp resolve this matter. Significantly, he mentions his brother Robert many times but uncle Edward nor any cousins not at all. We can still see no basis for him being styled 'of Bradninch, Wsq' since rhe Freehold for Bradninch was held (only) by the Duchy of Cornwall. [But we now see that anyone might simply assume that styling. if it seemed acceptable and  'fitting'  to one's peers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we haven't been able to deduce which Sainthills may have been resident in Rockbeare coincident with any  Churchills ca 1600s, say);  ie when they may both have lived there from the time of Edward Sainthill and his subsequent generations -  whatever their respective stations in the parish -  from ca <b>1550</b> to about <b>1650</b>, when Nicholas left.  We know from  Thomas Churchill's Will of <b>1577</b>, that Thomas  left 3 or 4 Churchill sons (William, Thomas, George and possibly a Robert) and  2 such grand children (both Johns) and  1 gt-gradson (a Charles)  but dates of birth and/or marriages  for same remain very approximate.  These would likely prove comparable in generation with those of Richard Sainthill(Snr)'s equivalents - in the succeeding 3 Peters, plus Edward, Richard and Francis. Samuel and Nicholas would be those of  Bradninch and Rockbeare/Topsham, respectively, living into  the  <b>1700</b>s.   We do have 2 items  concerning an apparently ?later  George Churchill: his Will of <b>1660</b> and a reference to him  being fined for something in the Civil war, later recscinded. Finally, from this ''pool' of Churchills would likely come thhose later of Ottery St Mary and area, just 2 miles to the east. From the Freeholder Lits for Devon we see that there were 6 such  Churchills listed as follows:  An oAmbrose Churchill was still in Rockbeare in  <b>1721</b>, likely George's son or grandson, as was a John Churchill;  a Charles Churchill was an Attorney at Law in Ottery St Mary that same year (requiting an Apprenticeship) - where an Edward Churchill also resided even earlier -  in <b>1711</b> and a William Churchill was there as late as <b>1762</b>. There was a Peter Churchill in  Shobrooke (near Crediton, a little to the north-west) -  in <b>1711 and 1721</b> - possibly the Vicar there and son of our earlir Peter. . There were also tthose Churchills  noted in Dorset in connction with Roger Curchill ca  <b>1540s-50</b>s in Bradford Peverell (Muckleford end), Lt Bredy and the Comptons - whatever induced them to also migrate to that  neighbouring county following the earlier William's move, with his sons Roger nad John ca <b>1525-35</b> or so.  </p>

<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may now return briefly  to the events at Rockbeare before <b>1500</b>  concerning those brothers Thomas and William Churchill (bn. there ca <b>1495</b>). </span><span class=rvts5>) The elder brother, apparently Thomas, would be ready to marry about <b>1516</b>, say  - to an Isault Provencher (an almost unique surname in the area; did she, or her father, hold property?

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But,&nbsp; these events, and the Megges connection, turn out</span><span class=rvts4> not</span><span class=rvts5> to have occurred with respect to that</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>seeming</span><span class=rvts4> earlier </span><span class=rvts5>Churchill manor </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in t </span><span class=rvts9>north Somerset</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; at all,&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>nor</span><span class=rvts5> to&nbsp; one wrongly assumed later to be in </span><span class=rvts9>north Dorset</span><span class=rvts5> either </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Munston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp;&nbsp; nor&nbsp; even to&nbsp; an</span><span class=rvts8>other</span><span class=rvts5> and actual Churchill manor, established l in </span><span class=rvts9>south </span><span class=rvts15>Devon</span><span class=rvts8> (</span><span class=rvts5>at Broadclyst or Rockbeare)&nbsp; !&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, it also appeared, importantly,&nbsp; to necessitate a reversal of </span><span class=rvts4>the order</span><span class=rvts5> in which Jane Peverell&nbsp; married her two respective husbands </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and to have done so in fact,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>in a quite different locale</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; namely, more to the south east - in</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts11>south Dorset</span><span class=rvts13> </span><span class=rvts69>–</span><span class=rvts13> </span><span class=rvts5>near, but not in,&nbsp; Dorchester</span><span class=rvts4>;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>that is, in neither</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts9>north </span><span class=rvts15>Somerse</span><span class=rvts8>t</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>nor</span><span class=rvts5> in </span><span class=rvts9>north&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts3>or</span><span class=rvts9>&nbsp; south </span><span class=rvts15>Devon</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> both further&nbsp; to&nbsp; the east- and in Dorset!&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, any confusion, </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>shadiness</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> or disquiet arising during this ambiguous period (as implied by Winston) is only compounded&nbsp; when we find in the genealogical literature differences of view regarding who was </span><span class=rvts9>the eldest son of William and Mary</span><span class=rvts5> (nee Creuse) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> once the family concerned had left Devon, and later Catherston&nbsp; in west Dorset,&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>apparently</span><span class=rvts5> settle&nbsp; eventually&nbsp; at what turned out to be one or other of the&nbsp; small manors of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts3>Muston</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>or</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts3>Pulston</span><span class=rvts4>, </span><span class=rvts5>both</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>nearer&nbsp; Dorchester in Dorset&nbsp; - where some Churchill&nbsp; may have settled (and thus </span><span class=rvts4>not </span><span class=rvts5>at any more north-westerly location&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> called,&nbsp; if similarly&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts8> </span><span class=rvts5>(in the former case), </span><span class=rvts8>Munston&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts5>as Winston had wrongly understood and assumed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He seems in fact to have had no inkling of&nbsp; from where&nbsp; the brothers Roger and John Churchill&nbsp; may have actually derived&nbsp; - if not&nbsp; north-west Dorset&nbsp; nor, before that,&nbsp; from an earlier&nbsp; Churchill manor in&nbsp; north Somerset.&nbsp; Nor did he have any idea who their father may have been&nbsp; - as </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill -</span><span class=rvts5> of</span><span class=rvts4> Roakbeare</span><span class=rvts5> (next to Broadclyst), in mid-</span><span class=rvts4>s</span><span class=rvts5>outh</span><span class=rvts4> Devon;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>ie</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts5>not in Somerset or Dorset, at all). </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foregoing&nbsp; is rather a lot to take in&nbsp; and re-orient on</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s self about.&nbsp; Winston had seemingly confused various disparate elements (people, places and dates) of the events described&nbsp; -&nbsp; with&nbsp; all elements wrongly approximated as well.&nbsp; And while </span><span class=rvts4>Muston</span><span class=rvts5> manor </span><span class=rvts8>would</span><span class=rvts5>, much later, become a&nbsp; property sold to the later</span><span class=rvts9> </span><span class=rvts15>Dorchester</span><span class=rvts9> Churchills</span><span class=rvts5>, it is possible that it too became confused with that&nbsp; similar manor nearby - called </span><span class=rvts3>Pulston</span><span class=rvts5> - in a neighbouring valley (of the Cerne) at the time of the Dissolution (and sale) of the Monasteries ca </span><span class=rvts4>1535-45 -</span><span class=rvts5> with their </span><span class=rvts8>many</span><span class=rvts5> associated and more distant manors.&nbsp; [Note: we have more recently seen reference to a Dorset Mnaor called </span><span class=rvts4>Pauston</span><span class=rvts5> which, phonetically, is of course very similar to that of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Pulston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; But its location today seems&nbsp; unknown.]</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, neither the Somerset nor the Devon&nbsp; manors&nbsp; called </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> were the site where the alleged events involving Roger, Jane,&nbsp; Mathew , or Nicholas Megges, unfolded.&nbsp; They had, rather, all occurred </span><span class=rvts4>only</span><span class=rvts5> further east - in mid-</span><span class=rvts9>south Dorset</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>after</span><span class=rvts5> the younger Rockbeare son </span><span class=rvts4>William</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>Churchill&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>(ca </span><span class=rvts4>1496 - ?1573&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>or, less likely,</span><span class=rvts4> 1583</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; seems to have&nbsp; migrated&nbsp; to </span><span class=rvts8>there</span><span class=rvts5> (with his young family) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; via&nbsp; Colyton, Catherstone&nbsp; and possibly Bradford Peverell (near Dorchester) -&nbsp;&nbsp; ultimately&nbsp; by the </span><span class=rvts4>1530s-40s</span><span class=rvts5>, it seems.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that makes 3 or 4 necessary changes of tack in our perspective !]&nbsp;&nbsp; And while a John Churchill could well be the </span><span class=rvts8>ancestor</span><span class=rvts5> of the later Churchills of nearby </span><span class=rvts4>Muston</span><span class=rvts5> (via Dorchester earlier),&nbsp; he had himself never settled in the latter </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but did so instead only in Dorchester itself </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; seemingly around </span><span class=rvts4>1540, </span><span class=rvts5>while his apparently elder brother Roger had likely done so&nbsp; at nearby </span><span class=rvts4>Bradford Peverell</span><span class=rvts5>, a little north of Dorchester,&nbsp; next to Charminster, with its </span><span class=rvts4>Pulston</span><span class=rvts5> manor a little to the north,&nbsp; where their father William&nbsp; Churchill (bn ca 1</span><span class=rvts4>496</span><span class=rvts5>), and younger sons, </span><span class=rvts13>may</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; have settled&nbsp; a little before that).&nbsp; But the latter certainly needs confirmation. </span></p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were thousands of Manors established throughout the country,&nbsp; even before the Norman conquest, the great many documents for which are now indexed on-line within the National Manorial Document Register (MDR).&nbsp; Sadly, Pulston or Muston manors in Dorset are not amongst &nbsp; them (although we have&nbsp; more recently noted&nbsp; that 6 such&nbsp; early documents for Pulston&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts13>are </span><span class=rvts5>held by the Dorset Record Office </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; but only for the </span><span class=rvts4>1470</span><span class=rvts5>s).&nbsp; There is also a property litigation document&nbsp; (C / xxx) in respect&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pulston&nbsp;&nbsp; - dated 15xx).&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironically, Munston (Manston) manor (also in Dorset, but to the north)&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts9> is</span><span class=rvts5> shown in the MDR&nbsp; -&nbsp; but with only one surviving document; (moreover,&nbsp; there were two&nbsp; other </span><span class=rvts8>Muston</span><span class=rvts5> manors nationally- one in Yorkshire&nbsp; with only two documents&nbsp; and the other </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> intriguingly also in Dorset (to confuse matters) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts8>Winterborne</span><span class=rvts5> Muston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>-&nbsp; some 5 miles south-east of&nbsp; Piddlehinton).&nbsp;&nbsp; About a dozen small villages in that area running west to east&nbsp; have a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>winterbourne</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; running through them; this is a small stream that disappears in the dry summers and only exists during the winter </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as a small&nbsp; winter </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>bourne</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; There are thus many such hamlets with this&nbsp; as part of their name;&nbsp; A small manor called Muston/Mustone&nbsp; was located in one of them.&nbsp; But the main manor of Muston (sometimes called </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Musterone</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>) and quite unrelated, was located some miles north-west of that more minor </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Muston Winterbourbe</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; manor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thus did so some weeks later - only to discover that while the&nbsp; records&nbsp; there did indeed cover the manor concerned&nbsp; (Piddlehinton) very thoroughly, they </span><span class=rvts15>didn</span><span class=rvts70>’</span><span class=rvts15>t cover or include</span><span class=rvts5> (whatsoever) </span><span class=rvts9>any</span><span class=rvts5> records for its neighbouring&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts9>manor of Muston</span><span class=rvts10>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; which, while also&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts11>the</span><span class=rvts9> same </span><span class=rvts11>parish-&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts9> of Piddlehinton</span><span class=rvts5> (as were those for&nbsp; that same-named&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Piddlehinton </span><span class=rvts8>manor</span><span class=rvts14>’</span><span class=rvts5>), wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t&nbsp; itself </span><span class=rvts9>a part of that latter manor</span><span class=rvts5> and </span><span class=rvts8>its</span><span class=rvts5> records </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but was in fact a quite separate manor (basically a large Farm with a quality house), albeit&nbsp; also located&nbsp; in that same large civil&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>parish</span><span class=rvts5> (at its southern end),&nbsp; along with or near two large ex-parish fields called </span><span class=rvts9>North and South Nouvard</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; The records for </span><span class=rvts9>Piddleninton</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts8>manor</span><span class=rvts5> itself </span><span class=rvts11>were</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; however those held at Eton - because that manor, along&nbsp; with hundreds&nbsp; of others, was, during and before the reigns of Henry V and VI,&nbsp; held by various religious authorities (Priories) </span><span class=rvts9>in France</span><span class=rvts5> - to where their annual profits had long been&nbsp; sent.&nbsp; Henry V (then at war with France </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as at&nbsp; Agincourt) decided that these monies should in future stay in England, so he transferred their ownership Leaseholds) to English Priories </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> from which rents he&nbsp; financed (endowed)certain&nbsp; new Colleges, as especially that at Eton&nbsp; - about&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1460.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>Its trustees then</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> became </span><span class=rvts9>the new&nbsp; Freehold Landlords of&nbsp; many such formerly Leaseheld manors</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; including Piddlehinton (until </span><span class=rvts4>1944 !) </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts9>but</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; sadly,&nbsp; not for Muston manoitself&nbsp; - almost next door in that same parish.</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main tenant or Copyholder at any given manor had then to keep records (Court Rolls) showing the rent paid - by any sub-tenant Copyholders&nbsp; - to&nbsp; be collected annually by the relevant Official of the new&nbsp; Landlord </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Eton College.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts8> </span><span class=rvts5>neither Muston&nbsp; nor Pulston (as learnt later) were one of these formerly French owned-manors, however</span><span class=rvts8>.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; Where were&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts13>their&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; manor records kept therefore, and to which Leaseholder&nbsp; did&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts13>their&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> chief Copyholders&nbsp;&nbsp; submit such&nbsp; annual accounts ?&nbsp; Taxes would, subsequently, have to be paid by&nbsp; that Freeholder to the government (King) of the day.

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did believe the Muston Lease was held&nbsp; in the mid-</span><span class=rvts4>1500</span><span class=rvts5>s by a member of the Bartlett family of&nbsp; nearby Piddleton/PIddletown and that its chief Copyholder then (the Tenant or Farmer) might well have been&nbsp; our </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> father of&nbsp; brothers </span><span class=rvts4>Roger&nbsp; Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> of Bradford Peverell (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1518-1552</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; and, seemingly,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; of nearby Dorchester (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1522-1557) </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>both (apparently) dying young at&nbsp; comparable ages&nbsp; of&nbsp; about 36</span><span class=rvts4>.&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>A line of Churchills, subsequently settled at Dorchester ca </span><span class=rvts4>1550-1800&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; descended from that latter&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>John (</span><span class=rvts5>and&nbsp; thence from his</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>son</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>William and&nbsp; the latter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s son John (d </span><span class=rvts4>1621</span><span class=rvts5>), in turn, etc ) - seems to have materialised initially </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>out of thin air</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - with no one ever querying who was </span><span class=rvts4>the father</span><span class=rvts5> (of that seemingly earliest, </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>first&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>John&nbsp; Churchill </span><span class=rvts5>of Dorchester</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts4> - </span><span class=rvts5>and thus the ultimate progenitor of the family only later recently at </span><span class=rvts8>Muston - from </span><span class=rvts5>ca </span><span class=rvts4>1612,</span><span class=rvts13> </span><span class=rvts5>as explained elsewhere).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I originally believed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the probable father of that&nbsp; earlier John&nbsp; - ie William Snr&nbsp; (or his 3</span><span class=rvts16>rd</span><span class=rvts5> son William Churchill Jnr)&nbsp; had eventually sought to purchase&nbsp; that&nbsp; Muston Lease- or Copyhold&nbsp; himself </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> around </span><span class=rvts4>1580&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts5>but this was</span><span class=rvts4> apparently </span><span class=rvts5>delayed until a&nbsp; subsequent purchase of those two&nbsp; neighbouring fields called North and South Nouvard&nbsp; - fittingly by a William Churchill </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1586;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>the&nbsp; purchase of the main Muston&nbsp; farm and&nbsp; manor Freehold was&nbsp; however delayed until ca </span><span class=rvts4>1610-12, </span><span class=rvts5>when</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>finalised</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>by those later </span><span class=rvts15>Dorchester</span><span class=rvts8> </span><span class=rvts5>Churchills - and not by their assumed progenitor William Churchill Snr (never </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of Dorchester</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; I now feel that Coxe got that wrong and that our progenitor quite possibly didn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t inhabit Muston manor at all&nbsp; or only briefly but, rather,&nbsp; did so mainly at nearby </span><span class=rvts4>Pulston manor</span><span class=rvts5> - in&nbsp; n north Charminster instead&nbsp; - bearly an hour</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s walk to the west.

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may imagine William Churchill Snr in conversation with one of his&nbsp; own father (Thomas of Rockbeare )</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s better off&nbsp; friends&nbsp; - either still in Devon or Dorset (as one of the the Wadhams, say),&nbsp; around 1</span><span class=rvts4>535</span><span class=rvts5> or so - discussing&nbsp; possible marriage partners&nbsp; for his (William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s) two eldest&nbsp; sons </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Roger and John.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, of course,&nbsp; we have&nbsp; absolutely no&nbsp; details&nbsp; concerning this&nbsp; other than assuming that something like this conversation and/or enquiry most probably would have taken&nbsp; place&nbsp; and that it resulted&nbsp; in&nbsp; introductions and negotiations&nbsp; with, respectively, the mother and step-father of&nbsp; Jane Peverell </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> recent sole heiress of an&nbsp; ancient landed family&nbsp; (in the case of&nbsp; first son Roger)&nbsp; and likewise (regarding second son John) with the parents (and especially the father) of Edith&nbsp; Bond&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a daughter of one of the established local Bond families of Dorchester and of Steeple in east Dorset.&nbsp; [Who, remarkably, may have changed their surname from </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Bonde</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> same generations earlier ![see Pole]&nbsp; This to be looked into when more convenient.]&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a meeting could well have taken place in the main town in the area </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Dorchester </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> by way of mutual acquaintances,&nbsp; as via the Cloth trade in Dorchester and/or Axminster or Exeter.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Since writing the foregoing, I have come across further detail on these matters. It seems that&nbsp; a William Peverell of Bradford Peverell, Esq&nbsp; (bn about </span><span class=rvts4>1490</span><span class=rvts5>s-</span><span class=rvts4>1500</span><span class=rvts5>) would marry&nbsp; Jane Baskerville,&nbsp; of Sherborne, Spinster,&nbsp; in about </span><span class=rvts4>1520</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; with whom he had a daughter and sole heir,&nbsp; Jane Peverell, about then.&nbsp;&nbsp; William&nbsp; died young soon after (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1525</span><span class=rvts5>),&nbsp; and his Inq PM in </span><span class=rvts4>1526/27</span><span class=rvts5> revealed that his&nbsp; property then consisted of…….. .[An&nbsp; earlier William Peverell had an Inq PM in </span><span class=rvts4>1502</span><span class=rvts5>, quite likely the younger \Willism</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father and it might yhus show&nbsp; similar property ownership.]&nbsp; Jane Baskerville</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father Philip Baskerville and family resided in Sherborne in his adulthood, although the centre of his family was apparently still in Herefordshire to thr north-west;&nbsp;&nbsp; he had possibly obtained a Teaching Position t at the new Sherborne Public School). Jane nee Baskerville (now Peverell) and her infant daughter Jane Peverell likely continued living at Bradford Peverell for only a short btime before she&nbsp; re-married - to Sir John Mervyn of Fontwell Magna, Wiltshire (just across the border with Dorset to the north) in about </span><span class=rvts4>1528.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; They may have then lived in either Bradford Peverell or at his own family estate inWiltshire </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in one or both of which Jane Peverell would presumably have grown up - through the </span><span class=rvts4>1530</span><span class=rvts5>s. , and possibly also at thevery small manor called </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Bardolphston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, near Piddleton, some miles north. </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, William Churchill (of Rockbeare and Catherston) b was on the look out for a suitable&nbsp; match for his eldest son Roger </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> around </span><span class=rvts4>1536-38</span><span class=rvts5>, say.&nbsp;&nbsp; The presence of Jane Peverell at Bradford Peveverell (now with her mother and new step-father (tJohn Mervyn)&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; no doubt brought to William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s and Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s attention. The young couple were likely soon&nbsp; married - around </span><span class=rvts4>1538-42</span><span class=rvts5>. Roger would thus become an Esq of that estate.&nbsp; They would have h two Churchill children - </span><span class=rvts4>Matthew </span><span class=rvts5>and</span><span class=rvts4> Margaret</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> likely in the</span><span class=rvts4> 1540s</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> before Roger sadly&nbsp; died, about </span><span class=rvts4>1552</span><span class=rvts5>, as estimated.&nbsp; It would now be the roles of John and Jane Mervyn (possibly nincluding William Churchill and his second son John Churchill in Dorchester)&nbsp; to arrange the futures for Mathew and Margaret.&nbsp; We can see now why that for Margaret was probably at Sherborne (where she would marry Barthlomew Olde of that town.&nbsp; But Mathew</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s future likelt remained at Bradford and so closer to Dorchester, where Alice Gould lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger Churchill&nbsp; thus married Jane Peverell (of a clearly landed family </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> then of Bradford Peverell and elsewhere (as Bardolfston&nbsp; nr Piddleton)&nbsp; about </span><span class=rvts4>1538-42&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>(as estimated) while&nbsp; his&nbsp; presumed slightly younger brother John would do so in Dorchester </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> when, as noted, he married Edith Bond&nbsp; at about the same time (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1539-41</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; One would assume that the latter marriage would entail&nbsp; less valued&nbsp; property </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>arrangements</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (for&nbsp; a second son)&nbsp; than elder son Roger would expect, and attain&nbsp; (</span><span class=rvts4>if</span><span class=rvts5> the&nbsp; birth order as presumed here is valid).&nbsp; Indeed, this would be consistent with Roger (not John) being the elder son and thus marrying </span><span class=rvts8>a sole heiress</span><span class=rvts5> of what </span><span class=rvts8>seemed</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; then a considerable landed estate (manor).&nbsp;&nbsp; Edith</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; branch of the Bond family didn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t appear to be quite as well off in property </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> possibly only renting at Herringston&nbsp; (but the senior line of that family </span><span class=rvts9>were</span><span class=rvts5> (</span><span class=rvts8>later)&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> quite well off&nbsp; - from both the Cloth&nbsp; trade and gaining certain other properties quite reasonably, we understand).&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; boys</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> presumed father&nbsp; William Snr and the rest of the&nbsp; family would&nbsp; likely remain for&nbsp; some time (</span><span class=rvts4>1540</span><span class=rvts5>s to&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1560s&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> at such as the Muston or Pulston manor farms on&nbsp; their&nbsp; presumed Copy or Lease held&nbsp; land (after leaving Catherston, say).&nbsp;&nbsp; The futures of any other sons (and maybe daughters)&nbsp; are sadly unrecorded in church or manor records </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> which seem not to have survived.&nbsp; Again, we accept that </span><span class=rvts4>the Lowman family</span><span class=rvts5> nay have been the major&nbsp; Copyholders - at Muston, at least -&nbsp; over an unknown later period.&nbsp; But they too were also in a position to Lease or sub-let their long-held Copyholds. </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many families based on inherited property in the countryside </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; before Elizabethan&nbsp; times - relied mainly on rental income for their livevihood and gentry status - but where a larger town or city (as Dorchester, Exeter, Bristol, Sherborne&nbsp; or, even&nbsp; London) was nearby and developing,&nbsp; younger sons, if sufficiently-educated, often made their way more lucratively there&nbsp; - in commerce,&nbsp; the services,&nbsp; government&nbsp; or the professions - as the 16th and 17th centuries unfolded.&nbsp; Roger Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s apparent younger brother John and his issue followed this latter route - in Dorchester</span><span class=rvts8> town</span><span class=rvts5> and, through businesses - in the Drapery,&nbsp; Clothing&nbsp; and&nbsp; Brewing trades - gradually acquired status and financial security.&nbsp; This was&nbsp;&nbsp; reflected in their purchasing property, marrying well&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>and</span><span class=rvts5> becoming elected to such positions as Bailiffs, County High Sheriffs, Local M.P.s. and with&nbsp; at least one a&nbsp; Barrister and another a Priest.&nbsp; We shall describe further details of this Dorchester branch&nbsp; of the family as descended from one of the many John Churchills later (see pp 90-112).&nbsp;&nbsp; But, on the contrary, we have next our p</span><span class=rvts8>rimary</span><span class=rvts5> family of focus - </span><span class=rvts9>out of town</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> disrupted as it may have been from any&nbsp; such smooth sequential progress, (compared to that of the Dorchester </span><span class=rvts8>town</span><span class=rvts5> branch) due mostly to early male deaths&nbsp; in the country over&nbsp; succeeding generations and hence difficulty in </span><span class=rvts8>holding</span><span class=rvts5> necessary property.&nbsp; Others did better by not only holding theirs, but&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>acquiring</span><span class=rvts5> more property, almost suspiciously, as we shall see, around mid-century.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These apparent facts, including details of the relevant&nbsp; marriages (possibly passed down in the Churchill family archives or by word of mouth) are not always verified in parish registers&nbsp; (often lacking) or other written documents.&nbsp; There is one Internet site which indicates that Roger Churchill and&nbsp; Jane&nbsp; Peverell may have&nbsp; married in </span><span class=rvts4>Sherborne, </span><span class=rvts5>Dorset&nbsp; - in about </span><span class=rvts4>1540</span><span class=rvts5> - and have&nbsp; their issue there.&nbsp; This is quite conceivable if one or other of Jane</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s parents (a William and Jane Peverell </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> she nee Baskerville) had died&nbsp; young and she was brought up in some relative</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s or step-parent</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s home&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in&nbsp; such as Sherborne (a town comparable to Dorchester but smaller - some miles north) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if, that is, her inherited estate at Bradford Peverell was possibly&nbsp; managed in the interim by some Leasehold tenant.&nbsp; I believe her mother and new step-father did live&nbsp; sometimes in that more northerly direction, or&nbsp; even&nbsp; in Wiltshire,&nbsp; ca </span><span class=rvts4>1530-45</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; initially, than in or near Dorchester (as in Bradford Beverell)&nbsp;&nbsp; [See litigation re </span><span class=rvts4>Sir John Mervyn</span><span class=rvts5>.]</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger&nbsp; and Jane could at most&nbsp; have had&nbsp; but one other child after Mathew </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in about </span><span class=rvts4>1550-</span><span class=rvts5>, say.&nbsp; Indeed, some pedigrees do show a daughter </span><span class=rvts4>Margaret Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> born to them; and such a birth&nbsp; in&nbsp; that latter year seems much more reasonable&nbsp; than one a&nbsp; full decade later (as shown on some sites, unless it was a&nbsp; much delayed baptism).&nbsp;&nbsp; For one thing, this Margaret Churchill&nbsp; married&nbsp; Bartholomew Olde&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> on 21 June </span><span class=rvts4>1574</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts9>in Sherborne</span><span class=rvts5> and by him had&nbsp;&nbsp; issue there </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the first&nbsp; in&nbsp; May </span><span class=rvts4>1575</span><span class=rvts5>, I believe.&nbsp; Had Margaret been born as late as </span><span class=rvts4>1560</span><span class=rvts5>, say, she</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>d be&nbsp; but 14 at her marriage.&nbsp; It seems much more likely she was born in </span><span class=rvts4>1550</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; therefore </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> not long before&nbsp; her father Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s early death - in about </span><span class=rvts4>1552</span><span class=rvts5>, as estimated.&nbsp; [The </span><span class=rvts4>1550</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; birth date could&nbsp; easily have been&nbsp; mis-read and/or wrongly&nbsp; transcribed at some later point </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> especially as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>1560</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.]&nbsp; She and Bartholomew had issue&nbsp; Sybil, John and William&nbsp; -&nbsp; all,&nbsp; including Margaret, referred to as still living&nbsp; as per their father</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; Will in </span><span class=rvts4>1595</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Who arranged their marriage, one wonders&nbsp; ?&nbsp; (Probably Sir John Mervyn.)&nbsp; What did&nbsp; Margaret bring to the union ?&nbsp; Her mother Jane was still alive in&nbsp; and&nbsp; through the </span><span class=rvts4>1570s</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not aware how the property arrangements concerning&nbsp; Bradford Peverell on Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; marriage (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1538-42</span><span class=rvts5> or so) would be affected by his early demise - just&nbsp; 10 or 12&nbsp; years later.&nbsp; There&nbsp; were&nbsp; of course now&nbsp; his&nbsp; two young Churchill children to consider, as well as Jane</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s future welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp; What would Matthew</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; inheritance rights&nbsp; be ca </span><span class=rvts4>1552</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> just&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>before</span><span class=rvts5> his mother Jane re-married ?&nbsp;&nbsp; And what were thyr just after ?&nbsp; The Megges were a family, originally from Kent (with clergy members seemingly associated with the&nbsp; Cathedral in Canterbury), who&nbsp; later settled in Ely (oddly, with its comparable Cathedral), but </span><span class=rvts9>in the distant&nbsp; Fens</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We don</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t know how they (or specifically Nicholas Megges) became thus involved in the future of a recently widowed heiress in rural south Dorset.&nbsp;&nbsp; How would he, seemingly in the distant Fens,&nbsp; even become aware of her first husband</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s recent decease ?&nbsp; No national newspapers in those days.</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was apparently not uncommon in those times for such as an uncle (ie of Jane or Roger) to instruct a lawyer friend or relative when next in London to enquire outside the Chancery Courts&nbsp; if other lawyers - typically from any and all other&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>provinces</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (who often congregated there)&nbsp; knew of any financially suitable second husband for a recent widow with property (and children).&nbsp; Or, equally, some interested bachelors may&nbsp; have&nbsp; left such a standing enquiry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, did&nbsp; the Anglican clergy have a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>network</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>; for&nbsp; they would know very soon when and where widowed heiresses of manorial property became available?&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, those printed transcriptions of just a few of Bradford Peverell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; baptisms, marriages and burials (over&nbsp; that 6 years period) at least provides us with some additional&nbsp; information that pertains to our earlier statement regarding the earliest members of the Churchill&nbsp; family to reside in&nbsp; mid-south Dorset (in or near Dorchester).&nbsp; For amongst&nbsp; those entries were several with the&nbsp; Churchill surname that at first </span><span class=rvts4>appeared&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> to have no </span><span class=rvts8>direct</span><span class=rvts5> connection to the particular </span><span class=rvts8>landed</span><span class=rvts5> family we have been investigating&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> that is, as descend more certainly from William Snr - via Roger or John </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in this immediate Bradford Peverell - Dorchester area.&nbsp; They could well have preceded them there (although later information further reduces that possibility).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These other Churchills&nbsp; in fact&nbsp; resided in Muckleford, that&nbsp; small hamlet, 2 miles west,&nbsp; attached&nbsp; to Bradford Peverell&nbsp; and, apparently&nbsp; part of that&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>same one combined&nbsp; parish </span><span class=rvts15>and Manor</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (although sometimes wrongly referred to as a sub-manor in its&nbsp; own right).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These Yeoman Churchills&nbsp; may have&nbsp; originated&nbsp; from such as&nbsp; third sons of&nbsp; third sons, as it were,&nbsp; elsewhere </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as in&nbsp; north Devon or even Somerset, with their forefathers having gradually drifted&nbsp; south-east from there over some generations - a century or more earlier&nbsp; and, only </span><span class=rvts8>coincidentally,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> settling in such as Muckleford&nbsp; (amongst several other places </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as the nearby&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Comptons</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; That is, that&nbsp; one of these&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>other places</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> just happened to come under&nbsp; an adjoining&nbsp; manor - of Bradford Peverell </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> that would soon&nbsp; be held </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if coincidentally - by a </span><span class=rvts8>Roger</span><span class=rvts5> Churchill of the more landed Rockbeare family </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a possible </span><span class=rvts8>distant</span><span class=rvts5> relation.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We assume that John was soon employed&nbsp; as a Draper himself - under the wing of the Bond family during these  early </span><span class=rvts4>1540</span><span class=rvts5>s and, only later, with the assistance of that family, as well as the&nbsp;&nbsp; Chirchills,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>and the Barrtletts</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; acquired that seemingly reasonable&nbsp; ex-Chantry&nbsp; property&nbsp; in which he and Edith were soon able to live comfortably in some improved style&nbsp; (for a Draper).&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a property seems to have become&nbsp; available&nbsp; by virtue of Henry VIII</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s recent wholesale acquisition of all such&nbsp; ex-religious properties about then&nbsp; which were often&nbsp; soon sold on - to&nbsp; other local buyers </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> generally at&nbsp; competitive&nbsp; prices).&nbsp;&nbsp; But then John&nbsp; died, seemingly quite young&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in </span><span class=rvts4>1557 </span><span class=rvts5>- and left a Will&nbsp; dated that year in which he left that&nbsp; property in Dorchester&nbsp; to&nbsp; his </span><span class=rvts8>elder son</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts13>William</span><span class=rvts5> Churchill (II) &nbsp; (then aged but 16 or so), and clearly </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of Dorchester</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> also. </span></p>

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John II had no sons and so, as noted,&nbsp; all that&nbsp; unexplained property soon went out of the Churchill family on his elder daughter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s marriage&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1593</span><span class=rvts5> to&nbsp; Maximillian Mohun (of another local and ancient landed family).&nbsp; As implied earlier, these&nbsp; Churchills who strongly appeared to descend&nbsp; from William Churchill of Rockbeare, seem to have&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; sufficient property, whether Copyhold,&nbsp; Leasehold or Freehold - through in-laws such as the Tylles , the Creuses, the Peverells, the Bonds&nbsp; and, in JohnII</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s case, the Collis or Collins family </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> his wife being a Mary 'Collis'.

<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recall also&nbsp; that in </span><span class=rvts4>1525</span><span class=rvts5>, when John I was still a youngster, aged about 7)&nbsp;&nbsp; there was already an&nbsp; older </span><span class=rvts4>John&nbsp; Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; in Dorchester </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> listed as a Bailiff there !&nbsp; [Unless he&nbsp; was somehow the same man </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but, </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of what line ?]&nbsp; This would normally be&nbsp; someone of&nbsp; sufficient local standing who oversaw decisions by the&nbsp; Court (as the payment of fines, etc).&nbsp; One naturally wonders - what was </span><span class=rvts8>his</span><span class=rvts5> origin ?&nbsp; Moreover, could he not be&nbsp; the younger John (I)</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>father</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> especially as that&nbsp; later John would himself&nbsp; be elected&nbsp; a Bailiff in his time. Why&nbsp; wouldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t a neutral researcher not take that as the&nbsp; most likely explanation ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the pedigree for the Dorchester Churchills&nbsp; (see elsewhere) oddly shows no </span><span class=rvts9>othe</span><span class=rvts5>r origin for them </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with John 1 simply appearing as though a&nbsp; ready-made </span><span class=rvts8>young</span><span class=rvts5> gentleman of leisure - with no apparent need of a father,&nbsp; an origin or an income.&nbsp; Or, even more radical, could he not be the same one John Churchill, an early Baailiff,&nbsp; born around </span><span class=rvts4>1500</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - elsewhere </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but, to whom ?&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might, however, usefully note here also&nbsp; what name John 1 give to his first son ?&nbsp; And why ?&nbsp; It was, of course,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts3>William</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; We may ask after whom would he most reasonably have been so named ?&nbsp;&nbsp; In most such cases, that name choice for a first born son does indeed&nbsp; honour that of the new father</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s </span><span class=rvts8>own father </span><span class=rvts5>(not his father-in-law).&nbsp; He was, fittingly, as we have strongly implied, most likely&nbsp; named after </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>Snr</span><span class=rvts5> (bn ca </span><span class=rvts4>1496</span><span class=rvts5>) - originally of the Rockbeare family and later (a</span><span class=rvts8>pparently</span><span class=rvts5>) of Pulston or Muston.

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might at this point&nbsp;&nbsp; consider for a moment that there was in fact no </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Churchill family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; then&nbsp; resident in Dorchester - about which one might later confidently&nbsp; generalise </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as a growing, accepted&nbsp; influence in Dorchester.&nbsp; There was but a teenage boy and two younger chidren living there, with their re-married mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; That teenager (or possibly his eventual elder son) would however be later interviewed by the visiting official from the College of Arms in london </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at their next </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Visitation of Dorset</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - and be duly informed regarding a newly constructed pedigree of his wn family - commencing as the&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Colliton Pedigree&nbsp; - for a Churchill line for which no origin is described or suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That visiting official then appears to have sought out no other possible (non-Dorchester) members (or informants) of&nbsp; that Dorset family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happily, something then&nbsp; transpired&nbsp; that helps us consolidate this interpretation.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was recorded in something called&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>The Casebook of Sir Francis Ashley JP, Recorder of Dorchester, </span><span class=rvts4>1614-1635</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> gratefully published by the&nbsp; Dorset Record Society&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1881</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; One case in particular, which occurred in Sept </span><span class=rvts4>1630</span><span class=rvts5>, was</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> cited by Michael Russell in his welcome article on </span><span class=rvts4>Benjamin Devenish</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sept 2 that year, Benjamin&nbsp; was&nbsp; in Dorchester with two other men -&nbsp; called </span><span class=rvts4>John Burd</span><span class=rvts5>, a Farmer, and&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>Jasper Churchill (!)</span><span class=rvts5>, shown as a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Cutter</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>(sic)</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>from London</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The three of them, seemingly close friends, had become embroiled in an altercation with a fourth man, </span><span class=rvts4>William Amey, </span><span class=rvts5>who had&nbsp;&nbsp; Complained to a Constable of their aggressive&nbsp; behaviour&nbsp; towards&nbsp; him.&nbsp; They were&nbsp; thus brought&nbsp; as Defendants&nbsp; before the&nbsp; local Recorder who concluded that they&nbsp; should at least be&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>bound over</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - to keep the peace - until the next Quarter Sessions</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; John Burd appeared to be the major culprit&nbsp; (having threatened&nbsp; to strike Amey&nbsp; with a stone, and even to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>kill him</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>) and so had to pay the&nbsp; larger penalty - of £40, while the&nbsp;&nbsp; other two paid only £20 each,&nbsp; to ensure they did indeed </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>keep the peace</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, or forfeit those sums.&nbsp; They must have kept the peace as, nothing further was&nbsp; knowingly reported on this&nbsp; matter.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; behaviour&nbsp; of&nbsp; John Burd&nbsp; proved however to be another case of </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>serendipity</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> for us </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; he being chiefly responsible&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; affray and&nbsp; the subsequent inclusion&nbsp; in Judge Ashley</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Casebook </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>of&nbsp; the names of all three involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; [We may recall our earlier </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>serendipitous&nbsp; dividend</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> was&nbsp; discovered in that litigation archive (Megges vs Lye) indicating that the Yeomen Churchills of Muckleford&nbsp; very likely derived from the same otherwise landed family of&nbsp; Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father William -&nbsp; Churchill </span><span class=rvts9>in or near Rockbeare, Devon</span><span class=rvts5>.]&nbsp;&nbsp; To see why this later revelation proved equally helpful to us, we must first correct an error in that the </span><span class=rvts4>Jasper Churchill,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>so fortunately reported on,</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t&nbsp; in fact&nbsp; a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts8>C</span><span class=rvts13>utter</span><span class=rvts5> - from London</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, but rather a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts3>Cutler</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; from that distant city;&nbsp; although, crazily enough, he might conceivably have actually been a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Cutter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>equally well&nbsp; - if that term denoted a specialist role for a Tailor (one who cuts out the pattern of cloth for any given garment).&nbsp;&nbsp; For the latter man (the actual </span><span class=rvts14>‘</span><span class=rvts15>Cutler</span><span class=rvts9> </span><span class=rvts5>of London</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>), was in fact the known son&nbsp; of the </span><span class=rvts4>elder&nbsp; Jasper Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> (Snr) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who had&nbsp; indeed trained to be just that - </span><span class=rvts4>a Tailor</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if&nbsp; more locally in Dorchester&nbsp; where he remained !&nbsp; [One couldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t make it up.]&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This William Churchill was thus now head of the Dorchester and Muston&nbsp; Churchills - from </span><span class=rvts4>1641</span><span class=rvts5> (and effectively from before that probably)&nbsp; until his&nbsp; death in&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1680</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; being&nbsp; buried at Muston&nbsp; (where some of the family had likely lived&nbsp; latterly).&nbsp; To what extent they still relied on the Drapery/Clothier and/or Brewing business in Dorchester for their main income and general position&nbsp; in local society (</span><span class=rvts4>or</span><span class=rvts5> increasingly on&nbsp; rental income from property in both Dorchester and Muston - over that&nbsp; lengthy and tumultuous 50 year period,&nbsp; I&nbsp; am&nbsp; unaware.&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming both&nbsp; parents and&nbsp; William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s siblings&nbsp; were by then&nbsp; no longer around, the Muston family then consisted essentially of&nbsp; William&nbsp; and Mary (nee Yarde)&nbsp; and</span><span class=rvts8> their</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; family - of&nbsp; 4 surviving sons and 3 daughters&nbsp; - born in the </span><span class=rvts4>1620s-30s </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> [</span><span class=rvts5>and thus contemporary with John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s young family atMinterne an/or Wooton, including u young Winston and his siblings. ] </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would all have then lived subsequently through the Civil War, the Commonwealth </span><span class=rvts8>and</span><span class=rvts5> the Restoration periods </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but as&nbsp; Roundhead or Royalist supporters&nbsp; seems&nbsp; uncertain. [We know rather&nbsp; more about the latter Wooton Glanville Churchills (as Royalists) over this same long and significant period.&nbsp; I read somewhere that Dorchester tended to cooperate with the Royalists both before and during the Commonwealth period but essentially sought to remain neutral.]&nbsp;&nbsp; That next generation&nbsp; were mostly now&nbsp; adults over that&nbsp; considerable&nbsp; post-</span><span class=rvts4>1640s </span><span class=rvts5>era.&nbsp; William was credited with&nbsp; (re-)building Colliton House around this time (possibly with Yarde money?) but otherwise appears to have sought&nbsp; to live the life of a quiet country&nbsp; gentleman at now family-owned Muston manor</span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> having&nbsp; only reluctantly, it was said,&nbsp; served briefly as High Constable (</span><span class=rvts4>1634</span><span class=rvts5>) and High Sherriff (</span><span class=rvts4>1640</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; for the county before the Civil war&nbsp; (which would soon begin), followed by Cromwell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; Commonwealth decade of the</span><span class=rvts4> 1650s</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; William would finally serve as&nbsp; Deputy-Governor for&nbsp; Dorchester during that latter&nbsp; period.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [We may recall that </span><span class=rvts9>the Royalist-supporting</span><span class=rvts5> Dorset lawyer John Churchill and his son Winston (of Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s line)&nbsp; were still living in Dorset -&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston at Ashe House - during&nbsp; those&nbsp; awkward times&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with Fines hanging over them both.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is hard to remember that they had&nbsp; descended&nbsp; so recently&nbsp; from the Roger-Mathew-Jasper branch of the Churchills - of Bradford Peverell (with some assumed support and influence by their Dorchester cousins).&nbsp;&nbsp; They seem&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; to have lived parallel lives in south Dorset&nbsp; to their respective kith and kin of Dorchester and Muston (to whom we had referred&nbsp; as leading&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>rather low-profile&nbsp; lives</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>;&nbsp;&nbsp; possibly this was more a function of their more local than national focus ?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Commonwealth and Restoration periods, it was&nbsp; William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s</span><span class=rvts8>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> son John Churchill 3 (</span><span class=rvts4>1622-1682</span><span class=rvts5>) who, in turn,&nbsp; led the latter branch of the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see that&nbsp; noWill was left by his father William&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> just 2 years before&nbsp; John, as eldest son, had also&nbsp; died.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter&nbsp; was a contemporary of&nbsp; Winston Churchill of Wooton&nbsp; (who had&nbsp; become, post-</span><span class=rvts4>1660,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> a local MP for Weymouth, and later&nbsp; knighted).&nbsp; Their </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>cousin</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> in London, </span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>Sir John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - would&nbsp; also serve later as an MP - (for Bristol).&nbsp;&nbsp; We may note that&nbsp; no Churchills in Dorset or Devon seem to have served such&nbsp; Parliamentary roles before </span><span class=rvts4>1660 -&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>as in</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> Cromwell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s day,&nbsp; or earlier, through theentire times of Henry VII&nbsp; o Elizabeth I.]&nbsp;&nbsp; But, over the following three hundred years, both branches of the family would display impressive competence in many spheres of leadership and public life </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> all descended it seems from </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill </span><span class=rvts5>of </span><span class=rvts4>Roackbeare,&nbsp; Devon - </span><span class=rvts5>of whom so little is</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>reflected in</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>public (or private?)&nbsp; records.</span><span class=rvts4> </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may recall our reference earlier to the surprising report that </span><span class=rvts4>a John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> had been a Bailiff in Dorchester as early as </span><span class=rvts4>1525 </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> implying&nbsp; his&nbsp; possible birth&nbsp;&nbsp; around </span><span class=rvts4>1500</span><span class=rvts5>, or earlier, say.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have since noted several&nbsp; entries for ?subsequent John Churchill(s)&nbsp; - in the roles of Witness, Constable and Bailiff (as just above),&nbsp; one would reasonably assume&nbsp; thhey were likely&nbsp; all the same man </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; continuing&nbsp; to about </span><span class=rvts4>1545</span><span class=rvts5>. or even </span><span class=rvts4>1549</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and still be in keeping with a birth of such a man around</span><span class=rvts4> 1500&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>or before</span><span class=rvts4>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; This could thus include the John Churchill, Clothier (and/or Draper) of </span><span class=rvts4>1549</span><span class=rvts5> and. even more, he who Witnessed&nbsp; the first sale&nbsp; noted -&nbsp; of </span><span class=rvts4>1538/39.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; The progenitor of the later Churchills of Dorchester&nbsp; we have&nbsp; taken however to be the John Churchill&nbsp; who married Edith Bond in ca </span><span class=rvts4>1540</span><span class=rvts5> and had as their first born a William Churchill&nbsp; in about </span><span class=rvts4>1541,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>and then Elizabeth (ca </span><span class=rvts4>!543</span><span class=rvts5>) , and finally a&nbsp; John Jnr in about </span><span class=rvts4>1545&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>(he&nbsp; later </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of Corton, Gent</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> all their subsequent marriages being consistent with such years of birth (not earlier) as would be that of their father John 1&nbsp; born ca </span><span class=rvts4>1520</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with a marriage of ca </span><span class=rvts4>1538-40</span><span class=rvts5>, respectively </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> rather than&nbsp; so significantly earlier (as </span><span class=rvts4>1490-505-&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> or </span><span class=rvts4>1525-30</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; say).&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, the seeming later John Churchill (Edith</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s husnand)&nbsp; died quite young (as initially believed) -&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1557</span><span class=rvts5> - aged on the latter&nbsp; basis, about 36-38.&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;&nbsp; [</span><span class=rvts5>A first marriage&nbsp; by ca</span><span class=rvts4> 1540&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> would&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>seem a little late&nbsp; for a John Churchill (a Bailiff in </span><span class=rvts4>1525) </span><span class=rvts5>, likely&nbsp; born about </span><span class=rvts4>1495-1500.]&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted, we found nothing before that </span><span class=rvts4>1538/39</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; entry for a John Churchill (as a ?youhg Witness)&nbsp; until&nbsp; a reference was noted (when examining earlier years)&nbsp; concerning that&nbsp; position of Bailiff for a man of this same name </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but for&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1525</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; But we now find something interesting for </span><span class=rvts4>1521</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; just four years before this, when&nbsp; a Charter was enrolled&nbsp; into the Dorchester records which stated that&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>Joan Aden&nbsp; (nee Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>), late wife of a&nbsp; Robert Aden,&nbsp; thereby granted&nbsp; to&nbsp; her son John Aden&nbsp; her house&nbsp; on the east side of South Street</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>which was next to that of John Williams (of a well off local family).&nbsp; It stated also&nbsp;&nbsp; that she had received this house as a bequest from her brother </span><span class=rvts3>Thomas</span><span class=rvts4> Churchill </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>to hold of the Lords of the Fee of the Borough of Dorchester</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Two Attorneys were&nbsp; appointed, as directed by the Charter, to ensure the legality of this&nbsp; transfer of the Lease.&nbsp; It was witnessed by two Bailiiffs and 12 others (!) - on 21 May, </span><span class=rvts4>1521</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if we assume that said Joan, then a widow with a grown son John, was then reasonably aged about 45-50, say, and her already deceased brother </span><span class=rvts4>Thomas Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> had left her the house as a bequest, and so possibly a&nbsp; little older than she, both&nbsp; could&nbsp; quite reasonably have been born in the period </span><span class=rvts4>1465-1475</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; (We may recall that our William Churchill of Rockbeare was the younger brother of a </span><span class=rvts8>Thomas</span><span class=rvts5> Churchill - thought also to have been born about </span><span class=rvts4>1490s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Thomas</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> was not a common forename amongst the Churchills considered&nbsp; thus far.)&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; that Devon Thomas seems to have left a Will dated </span><span class=rvts4>1577 (</span><span class=rvts5>at this point,</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>yet to be read</span><span class=rvts4>)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts13> </span><span class=rvts8>unless</span><span class=rvts5> it was that&nbsp; of a son (or father?) of&nbsp; this said Thomas (Snr) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who had possibly followed his uncle or nephew (William) eastwards to the Dorchester area ?&nbsp;&nbsp; [Note: The </span><span class=rvts4>1577</span><span class=rvts5> Will has now been read.&nbsp; [See pp&nbsp; ……as to its relevant contents.]</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, we find next, in going back to earlier dates,&nbsp;&nbsp; another Charter, dated the 11</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> year of the reign of Edward the IV (</span><span class=rvts4>1470</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; which recites details of a sale of a house on the south side of&nbsp; high West Street which was held previously by the Feeoffment of&nbsp; an earlier </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>, a brother of one </span><span class=rvts4>Osyth Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We might reasonably place the birth of such brothers around the period </span><span class=rvts4>1420-30</span><span class=rvts5>, say, and (most) likely within the same family as discussed above.&nbsp; An uncommon&nbsp; forename such as Osyth could prove useful in seeking out earlier relationships.

<p class=rvps19><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, this brings us within reach of our next find </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> being a portion of the Will of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>one&nbsp; John Chirchille</span><span class=rvts5>, dated 28 Oct </span><span class=rvts4>1418,</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; which was read out in the Dorchester Court on the 4</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> March </span><span class=rvts4>1420</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (7</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> Henry V) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> probably shortly after this John&nbsp; had died&nbsp; (and so became enrolled in the official, records with Witnesses, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; it,&nbsp; this John says&nbsp; “I, </span><span class=rvts4>John Chirchille of </span><span class=rvts3>Waddone</span><span class=rvts4>,</span><span class=rvts5> Dorset&nbsp;&nbsp; bequeathe&nbsp; to&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>John Chirchulle</span><span class=rvts5>, my </span><span class=rvts8>younger</span><span class=rvts5> son and his heirs, after the death of Margery, my wife, a Burgage with Curtilage adjacent (House and Garden), in West Street, Dorchester, (between those of Richard Turke and John Chalpin (?Chafin)).&nbsp; Again, we may estimate&nbsp; that said&nbsp; John, the testator, would&nbsp; likely be born around&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1360</span><span class=rvts5>, say, and so married Margery by about </span><span class=rvts4>1390</span><span class=rvts5>, and had their children around&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1400</span><span class=rvts5> or so.&nbsp; If he named his younger son after himself, this might&nbsp; imply he named his elder son (born, say, ca </span><span class=rvts4>1395</span><span class=rvts5>) after his own differently-named father </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> one ….?....

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we can report on a Chancery Proceeding (</span><span class=rvts4>E 179/ 363/ 275</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; concerning that possibly earlier&nbsp; John Churchill&nbsp; - of Waddone (Waddon), Dorset&nbsp;&nbsp; - which records&nbsp; Receipts issued for payments made&nbsp; pertaining to the Tythe tax (of one tenth of some assessed property values)&nbsp; collected for&nbsp; the churches in Salisbury diocese - by one </span><span class=rvts4>John&nbsp; Circholl</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (as so spelt in this Proceeding)&nbsp; for a local Abbot in one case - and then sent to Canterbury </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> dated ca&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1463 </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> 1465</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; it,&nbsp; we see that this John was described as the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Bailiff for&nbsp; the Abbot of Netley</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; This was a very impotant Abbey near Southampton Water from </span><span class=rvts4>1240 </span><span class=rvts5>to </span><span class=rvts4>1500</span><span class=rvts5>+.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may quote the National Archives website entry - for </span><span class=rvts8>the abstract</span><span class=rvts5> of this case - to gain some idea of the matter: </span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5></span><span class=rvts3>THE BARTLETT FAMILY </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts3><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After my disappointing examination of the </span><span class=rvts8>Piddlehinton</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; Manor documents held at Eton College (which</span><span class=rvts4> didn</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4>t</span><span class=rvts5> include those for Muston manor, as expected, despite both manors being in the parish of Piddlehinton), I reviewed the various results of my visit to the National Archives at nearby Kew,&nbsp; made during that same trip south&nbsp; (from Yorkshire) - still seeking information concerning&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill </span><span class=rvts5>Snr</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>(ca </span><span class=rvts4>1496-1570+</span><span class=rvts5>) , but without very much benefit either,&nbsp; the 16</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> century writing often being small and&nbsp; indecipherable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was however, reminded at some point&nbsp; that I should finally look up what I could find about the&nbsp; oddly named&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘’</span><span class=rvts4>Robert Bartlett, alias Hancock</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; which I had come across earlier on a number of&nbsp; occasions -&nbsp; as one who seemed to be somehow associated (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1540-50</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; with Piddleton, Dorset&nbsp; in general and even with Muston manor at times.!&nbsp; I had clearly left it on the periphery of my attention for too long.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has now been corrected and led to the following resume.&nbsp; We shall therefore consider this next before returning to our primary coverage of the </span><span class=rvts4>Dorset Churchills</span><span class=rvts5> per se&nbsp; (rom page 72) which may now benefit from any new interpretations facilitated by the insertion here of&nbsp; this&nbsp; 20+ page&nbsp; section on this most relevant family: </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts3>The History of&nbsp; the Bartletts&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts18>–</span><span class=rvts3>&nbsp; a&nbsp; Possible Template for Analysing the&nbsp; Churchills. </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a resume of what I discovered </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> often to my&nbsp; joy and amazement </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> about </span><span class=rvts4>the Bartlett family.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; But, before gaining any insight as to the specific name </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Robert Bartlett, alias Hancock</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5> which had caught my eye,&nbsp; I</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>d noticed a later&nbsp; Chancery case </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>C8/112/52</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>Bartlett v Browne and&nbsp; Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> at the National Archives .&nbsp; It was for some reason signed by one Hugh Wadham and&nbsp; concerned property in&nbsp; Lutton, Dorset </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> being the same parish from where our first Dorchester John Churchill (1</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s)&nbsp; wife Edith Bond, the daughter of one Richard&nbsp; Bond,&nbsp; had come </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> whose family&nbsp; appeared&nbsp; to be of&nbsp; long standing&nbsp; there.&nbsp; Both the Bonds and Wadhams, as I believed,&nbsp; had&nbsp; some&nbsp; connections with&nbsp; the Churchills&nbsp; and it now seemed that&nbsp; all three families had some mutual interactions, as well,&nbsp; with the Bartletts.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Bartletts&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; did not, on first examination,&nbsp; appear to represent a branch of that influential family that would advance&nbsp; our understanding&nbsp; of the origins of our Churchill family, although&nbsp; there </span><span class=rvts8>may</span><span class=rvts5> have been some clues there - so we&nbsp; examined&nbsp; this first.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, two bothers </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Thomas and Richard Bartlett, both of Lutton, Dorset&nbsp; -&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Husbandmen</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (with wives, Mary and Joan) -&nbsp; Complained that their father Andrew Bartlett , late of Lutton, deceased,&nbsp; had been seized of&nbsp; one Copyhold Tenement in the manor of Lutton (as recorded by manor Copy Roll) -&nbsp; for the term of their&nbsp; lives - with the Reversion thereof&nbsp; to go to their brother Andrew Bartlett Jnr,&nbsp; but&nbsp; Andrew Snr&nbsp; had also held&nbsp; the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Remainder</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (of the Tenement holding seemingly) and he had&nbsp; made a contract and agreement with one Thomas Corbett (?), also of Lutton,&nbsp; [at which point the text becomes too difficult to&nbsp; decipher reliably].&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp; I had it&nbsp; photo-copied&nbsp; at Kew and sent to me on-line - to scrutinise more carefully at home.&nbsp; Sadly, this was little better. </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disagreement&nbsp; seemed to involve the renting out of property and&nbsp; certain guarantees&nbsp; for other&nbsp; Bartlett children (Robert , Susan and Mary) to whom a John Churchill of Lutton, Yeoman paid £100&nbsp; (a lot then)&nbsp; and a certain Cottage&nbsp; with 4 acres was to go to&nbsp; a Henry Browne - who was to marry a Bartlett daughter (I believe).&nbsp; Figures of £60&nbsp; and £260&nbsp; were also mentioned.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there appeared to be no dates shown (other than some time after </span><span class=rvts4>1553</span><span class=rvts5> possibly), so one couldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t&nbsp; relate the timing and the individuals involved in these event in Lutton,&nbsp; to other events&nbsp; or earlier individuals of interest elsewhere.&nbsp; But, it later appeared that any earlier connections between the families concerned was more often at a higher level of social status&nbsp; than&nbsp; that here - of&nbsp; Husbandman and&nbsp; Yeoman.&nbsp; But the Esquires and Gentry would all have their&nbsp; share of&nbsp; those who&nbsp; soon descended to all levels of society below those of that status&nbsp; - with some later reversing this direction of movement. </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; may thus try to discover anything useful with regard to any interactions between such as the Bartletts and Churchills in areas nearer Muston or Pulston,&nbsp; say&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> hopefully&nbsp; above the level of&nbsp;&nbsp; Husbandman and Copyholder,&nbsp; as noted at Lutton&nbsp;&nbsp; If Subsidy taxes were paid by the Bartletts there;&nbsp; did&nbsp; any Churchills not at least engender records of their own presence there or nearby also </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in the</span><span class=rvts4> 1530s or </span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>40s&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>?&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there&nbsp; no extant records of same remaining (as any Muster lists) - unless one was an undoubted&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaseholder or Freeholder ?&nbsp; Manor records clearly show the names of&nbsp; Copyholders at&nbsp;&nbsp; neighbouring (Eton-owned)&nbsp; Piddlehinton&nbsp; Manor (eg - one Thomas Lowman);&nbsp; what might the comparable records of Muston or Pulston Manor Freeholders (as local Abbeys or even&nbsp; the Bartletts)&nbsp; show - in regard to any&nbsp; presumed Copyholder (or Leaseholder) renting&nbsp; from them - over that slightly&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>earlier</span><span class=rvts5> period ?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, after they sold it, rather later, to the&nbsp; other&nbsp; branch&nbsp; of the Churchills (those of&nbsp; Dorchester),&nbsp; who became or remained&nbsp; the&nbsp; Copy-&nbsp; or Lease-holder)&nbsp; of&nbsp; such Manor lands&nbsp; ?&nbsp;&nbsp; We can but travel hopefully </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> guided in part by an analysis of the Bartletts</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> comparable&nbsp; journey.&nbsp; [Try early Exchequer tax records ?] They stress their connections with three families in particular </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> including the Churchills. Surely their many records witness the name of those who held the Copyholds of Pulston and/or Muston (from ca </span><span class=rvts4>1530 </span><span class=rvts5>to</span><span class=rvts4> 1580</span><span class=rvts5>), say,&nbsp;&nbsp; ie&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts15>before</span><span class=rvts5> they sold the latter at least,&nbsp; over the&nbsp; period </span><span class=rvts4>1586</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts4>1612,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; to the new Freeholder </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> being now a Churchill of the Dorchester family</span><span class=rvts4> - </span><span class=rvts5>if oddly rather gradually, and piecemeal&nbsp; ?</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our focus was ultimately to be on this Bartlett family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s involvement in the Piddleton (Piddletown)&nbsp; area of Dorset,&nbsp; and in particular initially with Muston Manor of neighbouring Piddlehinton&nbsp; parish,&nbsp; in the period </span><span class=rvts4>1535-55</span><span class=rvts5>, say.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, the Bartlett</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; seem to have&nbsp; sold&nbsp; their Freehold in that small&nbsp; manor </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> by </span><span class=rvts4>1612 - </span><span class=rvts5>to a member of the Dorchester branch of&nbsp; the Churchill family </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; both branches having descended </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> seemingly - from a Churchill family of Devon who were of landed (Freeholder) status in the recent past.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; possibly senior&nbsp; branch appears to have been&nbsp; seated over the same period at </span><span class=rvts4>Bradford Peverell</span><span class=rvts5> (initially).&nbsp;&nbsp; Both&nbsp; branches&nbsp; emanated, we believe,&nbsp; from </span><span class=rvts9>the same one father</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>albeit</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>a Yeoman or&nbsp; Copyholder himself&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts11>for a time</span><span class=rvts8> </span><span class=rvts5>- whom we understood may have settled at either Pulston or Muston by mid-century </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ie from ca </span><span class=rvts4>1535-45</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; (after a shorter&nbsp; stint at Catherstone, in west Dorset, being friends (and inter-married with) the Wadhams).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the immense amount of data resulting from&nbsp; the fulsome&nbsp; investigations&nbsp; of the Bartlett family by their Australian progeny (especially by one </span><span class=rvts4>Peter Bartlett </span><span class=rvts5>apparently)&nbsp;&nbsp; provides promising potential&nbsp; in resolving our own uncertainties, we appreciate that&nbsp; it may&nbsp; well&nbsp; remain unresolved (for a variety of reasons) and so&nbsp; must continue to temper any optimism. </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall arrive at some of the details regarding this&nbsp; family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s presence in south&nbsp; Dorset after first describing briefly their origins and </span><span class=rvts9>subsequent spread in south England&nbsp; generally</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as gratefully provided by Peter Bartlett and family in considerable detail - after&nbsp; enormous effort and impressive&nbsp; searches of all manner of background records.&nbsp; This was then followed by their most comprehensive reporting of same.&nbsp; Thankfully,  no stones have been&nbsp; left&nbsp; unturned,&nbsp; nor unreported ! </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This first Bartelot in England,&nbsp; Adam de Bartelot (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1035-1077</span><span class=rvts5>), soon returned&nbsp; to&nbsp; Liseux however, to marry a French girl with whom he&nbsp; had two sons - Robert and Ralph de Bartelot&nbsp; - seemingly in the late </span><span class=rvts4>1060</span><span class=rvts5>s.&nbsp; (Marrying an English girl instead could compromise&nbsp; Norman property inheritance&nbsp; rights).&nbsp; In their&nbsp; protection roles, the Brionne</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s and the Bartelots were soon granted various manors and, in the case of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Brionne</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s,&nbsp; eventually raised to Baron status themselves.

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Churchills&nbsp; had also been granted certain properties in these same counties apparently, but they too suffered increasingly from having too few viable sons to inherit same </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> although it seems they&nbsp; managed to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>hang&nbsp; on</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (just).&nbsp; The marriage of their many more daughters soon diluted the extent of their earlier manorial holdings(portions of which would have to&nbsp; accompany their daughters to promote marriages).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the few remaining younger sons were necessarily reduced to the role of Yeomen as noted </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> renting or managing rather than owning property </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as Leaseholders or&nbsp; Copy-holders.&nbsp; But, through the Bartletts, this was apparently to change </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> especially from about </span><span class=rvts4>1540-50</span><span class=rvts5> - through the unexpected activities of&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>John and /or Robert Bartelot /Bartlett alias Hancocke</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Iohn&nbsp; had been&nbsp; appointed an Agent by Cromwell or his Deputy </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Tregonwell - for overseeing&nbsp; property sales after&nbsp; the Dissolution of the Mesenteries in the south-west.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will hopefully be described more thoroughly&nbsp; later.&nbsp; In the meantime, we continue describing&nbsp; that&nbsp; background of&nbsp; Bartletts in the west country more generally.</span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It could be argued that the Stopham estate was essentially the property of the Bartelots from the beginning however - to the extent&nbsp; that&nbsp; second Robert d</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>l</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>Eu</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s name might reasonably&nbsp; have arisen from (Ro) </span><span class=rvts4>Ber d</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4>-l</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4> ot</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; and&nbsp; soon shortened to&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>Bartelot</span><span class=rvts5> -&nbsp; rather than this latter name having arisen as&nbsp; mentioned above (through Bertha</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s son </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Berthelo, say).&nbsp; In any case, at Doomsday, the entry for Stopham was ambiguous (the scribes often assuming that future&nbsp; readers (essentially tax collectors)&nbsp; would know to whom&nbsp; a given Christian name </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts8>simply</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts8>entered on its own</span><span class=rvts5> for a given manor- as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Robert</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, say,&nbsp;&nbsp; typically referred&nbsp; only locally,&nbsp; unqualified by any other surname;&nbsp; a case can thus be made that a (Ro) bert&nbsp; [de</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>l</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>Eu]&nbsp;&nbsp; or </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Ro:&nbsp; Bertelot&nbsp; then held it and&nbsp; leased it back to his&nbsp; younger brother Radolphus&nbsp; (Ralph)&nbsp;&nbsp; de Bartelot) .

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; Stopham&nbsp; remained a Bartelot(later Bartlett)&nbsp; manor and effective centre for&nbsp; the&nbsp; original family for many years.&nbsp; About the year </span><span class=rvts4>1360</span><span class=rvts5>, a Thomas Bartlett&nbsp; of Stopham married Assuline de Stopham, whose son John in turn married a Joan de Stopham and a grandson, also John (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1425-1493</span><span class=rvts5>), married&nbsp; Olive Arthur about </span><span class=rvts4>1465</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Their two sons&nbsp; Richard and William Bartlett were said to be born in </span><span class=rvts4>1471</span><span class=rvts5> and ca </span><span class=rvts4>1475</span><span class=rvts5>, respectively.&nbsp; This brings us closer to our more understood Tudor century of the </span><span class=rvts4>1500</span><span class=rvts5>s - when we hope&nbsp; increasingly to find&nbsp; more&nbsp; information - with&nbsp; specific dates,&nbsp; places and names that quite soon a shift westward and ppear in Dorset</span><span class=rvts6>––</span><span class=rvts5> along&nbsp; with the Churchills, amongst several other interactive families, in that west country.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesingly, there were several Churchill entries in the records for east Dorset from the mid -1</span><span class=rvts4>300</span><span class=rvts5>s onward&nbsp; (see Wadddone&nbsp; manor record above.) Were any early Bartletts in the vicinity ?&nbsp; It was quite near to Lutton - where those later Husbandmen of that family were in litigation with a Yeoman Churchill.&nbsp; And was the former Churchill manor thought to be in Hampshire&nbsp; (near Netley Abbey) relevant ? </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Bartlett history, early members of their family gained in position and power by virtue of their close association with not only the de Brionne / Bryyan family, for whom Adam de Bartelot and his elder son Robert&nbsp; (and&nbsp; succeeding elder sons),&nbsp;&nbsp; had effectively become&nbsp; Stewards,&nbsp; but&nbsp; also with the&nbsp; Arundels, the chief family in the Bartelot</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; original base in Sussex (and elsewhere in the south).&nbsp; Thus, they often represented the nearby Kentish Cinque Ports&nbsp; as MPs -&nbsp; effectively as&nbsp; a gift from that dominant family - to whom Adam</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s younger son, Ralph and his line similarly served as trustees and accountants over future generations.&nbsp; These associations continued through the 13</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> and&nbsp; 14</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> centuries by means of a succession of mostly elder sons - Robert - in the first cases&nbsp; and of elder sons Ralph in the&nbsp; latter </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who tended to remain more at the family holdings at or near Stopham in Sussex, or in neighbouring Kent, through to the </span><span class=rvts4>14 </span><span class=rvts5>and</span><span class=rvts4> 1500</span><span class=rvts5>s.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significantly, however,&nbsp; one of the last de Bryan daughters, Maude,&nbsp; married a Ncholas de Mortaine (later Martyn) of Waterston Manor in </span><span class=rvts4>Piddleton, Dorset</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; It would likely be&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bryan</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s and Martyn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s presence and&nbsp; their contacts in Dorset (from that time </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ca </span><span class=rvts4>1380s,&nbsp; say</span><span class=rvts5>) that&nbsp; accounted for that union and property.&nbsp; And where the&nbsp; Bryans settled, the Martyns and the Bartelots/Bastletts (of Robert</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s line) were generally also to be found&nbsp; n -&nbsp; by virtue of receiving grants of property from the Bryans and by inter-marriages with them and other allied families.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Robert</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s line also benefitted from the Arundel connection </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as witnessed in the </span><span class=rvts4>1332</span><span class=rvts5> Will of one William Arundel (with wife Alice)&nbsp; by which this Robert de Bartelot,&nbsp; then already described simply as&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>of Dorset</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; was left property t</span><span class=rvts8>here</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - in Shaftesbury&nbsp;&nbsp; “..for himself and his heirs for ever.”&nbsp; [Just where ?

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bartlett&nbsp; history proceeds next with an account of the progression of that&nbsp; family in Dorset&nbsp; as they advanced from the period when, often as churchmen, they held&nbsp; several s&nbsp; church livings,&nbsp; to one where they began to hold more land as well, and also appesrmore in public office </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; initially in&nbsp; tht&nbsp; important centre of&nbsp; Dorchester and&nbsp; area.&nbsp; But first, a very good account is presented that sets the scene&nbsp; - of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts9>the times</span><span class=rvts10>’</span><span class=rvts9> then&nbsp; in Dorset</span><span class=rvts5> (and elsewhere in England)&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>times</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> that&nbsp; affected so many </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> including both the Bartlett and the Churchill families we must assume.&nbsp; We quote from the former</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s account (with light paraphrasing) which covers these matters from somewhat earlier:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Those (late 14</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> and early 15</span><span class=rvts16>t)</span><span class=rvts5> centuries)&nbsp; were difficul&nbsp; times&nbsp; in&nbsp; England - which had yet to&nbsp; recover fully from the Plague of </span><span class=rvts4>1348-49</span><span class=rvts5> - when half&nbsp; the population of Dorset was&nbsp; lost ..... .The country was&nbsp; still embroiled in its never ending (100 years) war with France&nbsp; and&nbsp; discontent with social conditions generally and&nbsp; with the church in particular&nbsp; was making itself felt.&nbsp; It was also a bad time for the Bartletts </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to have lost the patronage of the now deceased Bryans - enjoyed for so long. Their own status gradually changed and would affect future generations&nbsp; as well.&nbsp; Like most Dorset families, they&nbsp; (and the Bryans) had been decimated by the plague </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with their numbers much reduced by the start of the 15</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> century.&nbsp; All the known Bryan estates had been sold or inherited by other families - except for Stockwood Manor (between Sherborne and Dorchester)&nbsp; and&nbsp; where, as late as</span><span class=rvts4> 1423,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> its Manor Court records show that a Phillipa de Bryan, unmarried daughter of the last Sir Guy de Bryan, still resided there </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> along with her longest serving ?Steward&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Sir William Bartelot - possibly as a Lessee of the estate.&nbsp; This status was still the case according to the Manor Court records there in </span><span class=rvts4>1444</span><span class=rvts5>. Over the ensuing&nbsp; years,&nbsp; one or more Richard&nbsp; Bartlett(s)&nbsp; held positions as Vicar&nbsp; locally - in two of the many Winterborne parishes </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in south-east Dorset (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1455-95), </span><span class=rvts5>while</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> aRev Henry Bartlett&nbsp; was </span><span class=rvts4>Vicar at Charminster</span><span class=rvts5> about&nbsp; then -&nbsp; while residing at neighbouring&nbsp; Fordington,&nbsp; on the north edge of Dorchester.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be about this time (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1476</span><span class=rvts5>) that Sir Robert de Bartelot&nbsp; was entrusted by Edward&nbsp; IV&nbsp; to bestowe&nbsp; the&nbsp; Order of the Garter upon a foreign Duke&nbsp; - of Urbino </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> an Italian nobleman&nbsp; then acknowledged as the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Renaissance Man</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> par excellence - of all Europe. There must have been de Bartelots&nbsp; then&nbsp; in Royal service of the first Tudor&nbsp; - Henry VII&nbsp; - in&nbsp; London .

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious from the above summary that the Batrletts became settled in many parishes and manors in Dorset, and Somerset </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>during the two centuries from the </span><span class=rvts4>1340s&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>to</span><span class=rvts4> 1540s+</span><span class=rvts5>. As explained, they did so initially due to their close association with two particular families </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the&nbsp; Bryans and the Arundels, with later connections with the Martyns,&nbsp; de la Lyndes and Kellaways.&nbsp; During those 200+ years, there would of course be an impressive 10&nbsp; or so generations </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; of marriages, births and&nbsp; a consequent redistributions of granted, purchased&nbsp; or inherited properties - in many such districts.&nbsp; This would no doubt&nbsp; entail&nbsp; various Robert, John, Richard, William and&nbsp; Thomas Bartletts&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; respectively marrying&nbsp; on many occasions into a&nbsp; plethora&nbsp; of other </span><span class=rvts8>similarly landed</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; or </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>near landed</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> middle class families (including the Martyns and Churchills) - so acquiring&nbsp; further property and local and national positions of public office&nbsp; and influence.&nbsp; Clearly, we make&nbsp; no attempt to analyse&nbsp; and distil all this potential detail - from either the Bartlett history itself&nbsp; nor from examining countless other&nbsp; archive sources so arising </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> including many property transfers or litigation documents generally over the entire&nbsp; area and period.&nbsp; It was clearly a complex, inter-woven network.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our task, rather, is simply to identify&nbsp; the most likely individual&nbsp; Bartletts&nbsp; who were&nbsp; responsible for acquiring, and later selling, any particular and&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>relevant&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> Dorset properties&nbsp; in the times of the early Tudors&nbsp; that may impinge upon the lives of the early Churchills&nbsp; - in such as&nbsp; Piddleton,&nbsp; Piddlehinton&nbsp; and associated manors.&nbsp; as well as in nearby Dorchester, Charminster&nbsp; and&nbsp; Bradford Peverell.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, once doing so, to determine if the major Lease- or Copy-holders of same, under any Bartlett Freeholds were ever, from about the </span><span class=rvts4>1530s </span><span class=rvts5>to</span><span class=rvts4> 1560s,</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; a particular (temporary) Yeoman - one </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1496-1580s</span><span class=rvts5>) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who was&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts11> not</span><span class=rvts5> of the junior&nbsp; branch of that Dorset family near there then -&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts15>centred primarily on </span><span class=rvts11>Dorchester</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but was,&nbsp; rather, </span><span class=rvts9>the&nbsp; progenitor of&nbsp; both that branch</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; and&nbsp; the apparently more senior one settled&nbsp; initially at&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts11>Bradford&nbsp; Peverell</span><span class=rvts8>&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts5>with a possible earlier association with Catherston in west Dorset.&nbsp; The small manor at&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>Pulston</span><span class=rvts5> in the north of Charminster (which parish neighbours Bradford Peverell), was a thought to be one such.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Intriguingly, a Burial entry for said William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s daughter-in-law Jane nee Peverell was noted (for </span><span class=rvts4>1578/9</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; in the </span><span class=rvts8>Charminster</span><span class=rvts5> register itself .)&nbsp; Moreover, we see that her father William Peverell (d ca </span><span class=rvts4>1520</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; was once described as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of Bardalphston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> being a manor in or&nbsp; near Piddleton </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as well as&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of Bradford Peverell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; What could that imply, if anything,&nbsp; with regard to William Churchill arranging a marriage between his eldest son Roger and said Jane Peverell </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1535-40</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> she then a sole heiress ?&nbsp; It seems to imply that there&nbsp; could&nbsp; be a Bartlett&nbsp; invluence in those arrangements that early.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of the Bartletts continues with the fact that&nbsp; from&nbsp; the </span><span class=rvts4>de la Lynde</span><span class=rvts5> family descended&nbsp; members of the Collier and Lowman (Lawman)&nbsp; families who were more clearly Lessees and/or Copyholders of&nbsp; property in or near Piddleton </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> apparently owned by the Bartletts.&nbsp; In addition, a&nbsp; Robert Bartlett of the day either leased himself or owned a former Holles property nearby.&nbsp; This family, who produced a famous MP for Dorchester,&nbsp;&nbsp; were apparently also related to&nbsp; two or three of those other relations.&nbsp;&nbsp; We did note that the rent paid for farms&nbsp; then owned by Eton College - </span><span class=rvts9>in nearby Piddlehinton&nbsp; manor</span><span class=rvts5> itself&nbsp; (but </span><span class=rvts4>sadly, not Muston </span><span class=rvts5>itself</span><span class=rvts4>,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> albeit located in that same </span><span class=rvts8>parish</span><span class=rvts5>) - was indeed&nbsp; paid&nbsp; in Tudor times by that then current Lessee or&nbsp; Copyholder </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; Thomas </span><span class=rvts4>Lowman</span><span class=rvts5>, and&nbsp; his&nbsp; sons in turn.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible that comparable Manor Court records for neighbouring Muston Manor could show that the Lowman family also&nbsp; paid&nbsp;&nbsp; rents for same there -&nbsp; although one</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s initial&nbsp; understanding was&nbsp; that they were in fact&nbsp; paid (for a time),&nbsp; by </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill </span><span class=rvts5>Snr (born ca </span><span class=rvts4>1496</span><span class=rvts5>), and later&nbsp; by&nbsp; his </span><span class=rvts8>third</span><span class=rvts5> son William Jnr (born ca </span><span class=rvts4>1525-30</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, surely the records for same by which this could be ascertained one way or the other haven</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t simply disappeared ?&nbsp; The names of the Muston Lessee or Copyholder through the period </span><span class=rvts4>1530 to 1590, say,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> haven</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t,&nbsp; we assume,&nbsp; disappeared !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the precise relationships amongst the Bartelots at this time is difficult to determine, certain connections may be suggested.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were three other families in these same areas of Dorset about then with whom the Bartletts&nbsp; also interacted&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; the&nbsp; Prowts/Prouts, the Frekes and the Churchills </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and information on them could help clarify relationships, places&nbsp; and dates for all four families.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bartletts had&nbsp; known the&nbsp; Prout family “for a very long time and (were)&nbsp; linked to them by a series of marriages”, notes the Bartlett history.&nbsp; They too&nbsp; were&nbsp; of Norman descent and were major landowners - at Litton Cheney, Frampton and Bridport&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - (south-west of Dorchester).&nbsp;&nbsp; They had been Mayors and Bailiffs of Bridport and a William Prout had been a Dorset MP&nbsp; in Parliament.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hutchins, in his famous&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>History of Dorset</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; shows&nbsp; an&nbsp; estate near Litton Cheney&nbsp; to be occupied by the Bartelots&nbsp; - initially </span><span class=rvts8>as Lessees</span><span class=rvts5> - of&nbsp; absentee owners (whohad&nbsp; likely purchased it from the Prouts)&nbsp; then residing in Hampshire.&nbsp; It was headed then or a little later by one&nbsp; George Bartelot who apparently&nbsp; purchased the estate outright around </span><span class=rvts4>1500,</span><span class=rvts5> and it was later in the hands of </span><span class=rvts8>his son</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>John Bartlett</span><span class=rvts5>, before </span><span class=rvts4>1525</span><span class=rvts5> - when his name appears as a&nbsp; payer of the&nbsp; Subsidy tax there (of £25).&nbsp; His son in turn, </span><span class=rvts8>another </span><span class=rvts11>John Bartlett</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>, was also shown paying tax there&nbsp; a little later&nbsp; (</span><span class=rvts4>1539</span><span class=rvts5>- at £35),&nbsp; as well as appearing on the local Muster list&nbsp; for</span><span class=rvts4> 1542</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>being </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>mounted on horse and armed</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In </span><span class=rvts4>1545</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; this younger John&nbsp; now paid&nbsp; the&nbsp; £25 Subsidy there&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; the estate&nbsp; apparently remaining in the family into the </span><span class=rvts4>1600</span><span class=rvts5>s.&nbsp;&nbsp; We assume that the Prout family had continued in the area&nbsp; as well, beyond the&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts4> 1540s,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> as a Prout daughter would marry a Bartlett son </span><span class=rvts4>in Piddleton</span><span class=rvts5> about then (see below).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second close family, the Frekes, were&nbsp; also considerable&nbsp; landowners and&nbsp; held&nbsp; influential&nbsp; positions in the legal profession and in local government. They too were linked by marriage&nbsp; to all three of the families concerned.&nbsp; Thus, a Joan Prout, who had married a Thomas Freke, (in about </span><span class=rvts4>1500</span><span class=rvts5>), was related to the&nbsp; Alice Prout&nbsp; who would&nbsp;&nbsp; marry Robert Bartlett at Piddleton&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1542</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The Freke name&nbsp; comes up again later.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third family long associated with the Bartletts werof course the&nbsp; Churchills who, according to the Bartlett history,&nbsp; had also arrived in England&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1066</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - with the name </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>de Courcelle</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as part of a contingent led by Count Robert de Mortaine (later Martyn) and Count Guido de Brionne (later Bryan).&nbsp; As we have noted, the latter two were both in a position to grant lands to their closest associates and followers - in those same parts of Wessex (ie Somerset, Devon and Dorset) where the Bartelots enjoyed similar advantages.&nbsp; All four family names thus appeared close to one another in those earliest years (</span><span class=rvts4>1300s-1400s</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; By the mid-</span><span class=rvts4>1400</span><span class=rvts5>s,&nbsp; the Churchill name had&nbsp; appeared in or near Dorchester,&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; in Court circles in London.&nbsp; (We have described&nbsp; above their earlier presence as well&nbsp; in Somerset and Devon ca </span><span class=rvts4>1130s -1500+.)</span><span class=rvts5> [And now around Corton and Waddon, soth Dorset.] </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also Bartelots living in or near&nbsp; Dorchester&nbsp; around these dates,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; in&nbsp; adjoining Fordington&nbsp; and Stinsford.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Robert Bartlett had been Mayor in Dorchester in </span><span class=rvts4>1450-53</span><span class=rvts5> as note above and his apparent son John was Bailiff there as also mentioned.&nbsp; Shortly after,&nbsp; they&nbsp; likely resided in one or other of those latter nearby manors </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with which&nbsp; the Bartletts would still be&nbsp; associated well into the </span><span class=rvts4>1600</span><span class=rvts5>s.&nbsp; If we assume that Robert would have been born by about </span><span class=rvts4>1415,</span><span class=rvts5> and married ca </span><span class=rvts4>1440</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; his son John would likely be born shortly after (by ca </span><span class=rvts4>1445, say</span><span class=rvts5>) and&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonably be a Bailiff by the </span><span class=rvts4>1470s.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Will was witnessed by John Butt, Roger Riche, John Jollyett and John Bonde&nbsp; - who were to receive two sheep each&nbsp; (ie 8 in total&nbsp; - 4 from Robert and 4 from Agnes, so divided). </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>for their pains</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Will was proved on March 1</span><span class=rvts16>st</span><span class=rvts5>, </span><span class=rvts4>1558/59&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> by the son Robert Bartlett. as Executor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert would likely be about 35-40 then&nbsp;&nbsp; and so the eventual sale of Muston by one Nathaniel Bartlett&nbsp; after </span><span class=rvts4>1600</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; would quite possibly&nbsp; be a grandson of this Robert, born about </span><span class=rvts4>1570</span><span class=rvts5>, say, to a son of said Robert - of almost any forename </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> born about </span><span class=rvts4>1540-50</span><span class=rvts5>;&nbsp; there were several&nbsp; Bartletts born in Piddleton&nbsp; then, I believe.&nbsp; He would presumably be the eldest surviving son of a Bartlett of this same status. We find no Will later listed for either John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s widow Agnes&nbsp; or&nbsp; his son Robert - although there is an intriguing entry in the Archives for an Inquisition Post Mortem on </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Robert Bartlett alias Hancock</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> dated&nbsp; Nov </span><span class=rvts4>1577-78</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>(C 142/ 180/ 27)</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; and an associated&nbsp; record&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>WARD 7/</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>20/ 24</span><span class=rvts5> of same date pertaining to issue of same.&nbsp; These have yet to be examined (with interet). </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, we&nbsp; see there is a&nbsp; Proceeding </span><span class=rvts4>C2/Eliz/ B3/ 60</span><span class=rvts5> in which a William Bartlett and John Style&nbsp; Complain against a William Frampton and wife Emma&nbsp; in which reference is made to&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>the Will of&nbsp; Alice Bartlett alias Hancock</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; for whom the Complainants were or had been Executors. The brief resume notes that it concerned a possible Fraud in regard to a Contract pertaining to&nbsp; Muston Farm, Piddlehinton&nbsp; and&nbsp; a House in Puddletown called Islington House which is or was owned by Robert Bartlett.

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should note that young men just starting out in life as married adults&nbsp; would&nbsp; of course be very interested in the availability of any reasonably-priced </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>first homes</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> for their expected families.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was certainly the case for young John Churchill in Dorchester around the </span><span class=rvts4>1540</span><span class=rvts5>s where, without any significant funds we know of,&nbsp; he suddenly acquired a very good ex-Chantry property&nbsp; ca&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1545 </span><span class=rvts5>(although the sales documents may have been delayed, entailing&nbsp; a succession of transfers and unrecognised nmames, to a later date).&nbsp; One might find that these recently married&nbsp; sons of John Bartlett similarly so appear, otherwise unexpectedly,&nbsp; in different&nbsp; towns and villages in south Dorset which had recently been the property of&nbsp; various religious foundations.&nbsp; It appears that some of the other contemporary Churchills also so benefitted </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as at Little Bredy,&nbsp; Comptons,&nbsp; Frampton&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>and</span><span class=rvts5> Pulston (!).&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bartlett family history soon provided&nbsp; answers&nbsp; to some of the above questions when it continues with a new section in which we learn that&nbsp; “…</span><span class=rvts4>John Bartelot&nbsp; had been&nbsp; appointed to the position of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Investigator of Monasteries</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4>.”</span><span class=rvts5> .But how would such an&nbsp; appointment have come about, for a small Freeholder living in Piddleton,&nbsp; in rural Dorset ?&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; would have resulted, says the history (somewhat vaguely),&nbsp; through&nbsp; “</span><span class=rvts8>influences exerted by other members of the Bartelot family</span><span class=rvts5>” </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> that is, by those of William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s generation, or before (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1530s-40s</span><span class=rvts5>),&nbsp; partly back in Sussex but, one feels,&nbsp; mainly&nbsp; in London.&nbsp; This&nbsp; appointment&nbsp; must have transpired by about </span><span class=rvts4>1536-38</span><span class=rvts5>, when John would have been coming up 40 </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with&nbsp; his children </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>back home&nbsp; - about to marry&nbsp; in Piddleton, or nearby,&nbsp; and settle down&nbsp; - wherever they reasonably could .&nbsp; Just where that </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>wherever</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> might be&nbsp; for them (and their friends and relatives) could soon&nbsp; be influenced&nbsp; from a much greater choice throughout Dorset -&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>than would otherwise have been the case</span><span class=rvts5> -&nbsp; previously&nbsp; -&nbsp; as we shall see.&nbsp; After becoming an Agent or Commissioner,&nbsp; John Bartlett&nbsp; was becoming&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>a good man to know</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, or </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>be related to</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>- especially for that next aspiring generation. </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that some years before,&nbsp; the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s chief minister Thomas Cromwell had taken an interest in a legal wrangle in which&nbsp; land had been apparently aken from the Bartelots&nbsp; in Sussex by some nefarious means.&nbsp; He became aware of the latter family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; apparent bona fides,&nbsp; trustworthiness and&nbsp; general competence and subsequently assisted those of that family who had&nbsp; settled in the&nbsp; west country&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts8>where he was&nbsp; once an MP</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - for Taunton </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; in gaining various appointments at Court in London </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> from ca </span><span class=rvts4>1530</span><span class=rvts5> or so.&nbsp; Thus, John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s brother Richard Bartelot,&nbsp; became&nbsp; one of Cromwell</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Secretaries.&nbsp; Henry 8</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> would soon dissolve&nbsp; the&nbsp; Monasteries (and all related religious institutions) and, by about </span><span class=rvts4>1535,</span><span class=rvts5> they were </span><span class=rvts8>starting</span><span class=rvts5> to be&nbsp; sold off&nbsp; in considerable numbers, generally&nbsp; to the highest local bidder (and often&nbsp; then re-sold)&nbsp; - with money yhus pouring into the country</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; (and Henry</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s) Treasury, and likely into the profits of&nbsp; such local Agents (to buy such as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Wooden Houses</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (in Dorchester ?).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was thus considerable&nbsp; scope for fraud and improper valuations&nbsp; in such a massive sell off.&nbsp; When the King asked&nbsp; Cromwell to organise some oversite, he seems to have chosen </span><span class=rvts3>Sir John Tregonwell</span><span class=rvts5> to be the </span><span class=rvts8>Chief Inspector</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at least for&nbsp; the south-west of England in this respect.&nbsp; Sir John was a very bright man out of Cornwall who thrived at Oxford in Civil Law.&nbsp; He was soon holding important government positions in London and amongst other activities,&nbsp; had successfully guided the King in the legality of his recent divorce proceedings against Catherine of Aragon.&nbsp; Sir John&nbsp; later&nbsp; settled in&nbsp; south&nbsp; Dorset himself - around </span><span class=rvts4>1534</span><span class=rvts5> - on marrying&nbsp; the widow of&nbsp; one of the landed </span><span class=rvts4>Martyn family</span><span class=rvts5> of that&nbsp; county and thus soon knew most of the local land owners nearby.&nbsp; His marriage ensured that he was then related to a number of such inter-married local Dorset families - as the&nbsp;&nbsp; Bartletts, the Churchills, the Kellaways and the Martyns - all of whom owned or would soon own property in and near Piddleton&nbsp; (and of course elsewhere&nbsp; across south Dorset). </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of these was a near neighbour -&nbsp; John Bartelot/Bartlett of same - whom he appointed to be one of his Investigators and later a Commisioner&nbsp; (to first value all&nbsp; local church and Abbey properties&nbsp; and </span><span class=rvts13>their many associated manors. mills and advowsons (church livings</span><span class=rvts4>)</span><span class=rvts5> pertaining thereto !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those in these inter-related families who hadn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t inherited the first (eldest) son</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s major share of theie families</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts8> existing</span><span class=rvts5> small estates,&nbsp; through primogeniture, would suddenly now be </span><span class=rvts8>very</span><span class=rvts5> interested in any&nbsp; new properties that might now become available -&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>in the new situation</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp;&nbsp; ie&nbsp;&nbsp; - for 2</span><span class=rvts16>nd</span><span class=rvts5> and 3</span><span class=rvts16>rd</span><span class=rvts5> sons, especially </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ca </span><span class=rvts4>1540s</span><span class=rvts5>-</span><span class=rvts4>50s</span><span class=rvts5> !&nbsp; Monasteries and Abbeys were of prime interest when they also owned so many properties&nbsp; for income) in&nbsp; more distant, often rural, parishes - much beyond their own immediate Abbey grounds.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the prelude to the description of this sale, one cannot but assume that the previous Freeholder of all this property must have been one or more of the larger local Abbeys or Monasteries recently acquired and then&nbsp; sold </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>by the Crown</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; following the Dissolution of the Monasteries Act&nbsp; of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1535</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Yet,&nbsp; just who so held the Freehold of Muston Manor (and Farm), or that of Pulston,&nbsp; themselves, prior to </span><span class=rvts4>1545,</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; is not explicitly mentioned.&nbsp; We may however reasonably assume that it had been Cerne Abbey </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> until some uncertain date ca </span><span class=rvts4>1540-47</span><span class=rvts5>, say.&nbsp; In regard to that latter Abbey, we may note comments provided&nbsp; in an excellent site devoted to that institution </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> see:&nbsp; cerneabbeyhistory.org&nbsp;&nbsp; pertaining to&nbsp; that period:&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>“… that latter chief Overseer seems nevertheless to have continued to treat John with considerable tolerance…”&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may have related to john</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s friendship with Sir John Tregonwell </span><span class=rvts4>and</span><span class=rvts5> to the incriminating evidence&nbsp; that others had, in any caase, already&nbsp; obtained&nbsp;&nbsp; regarding the Abbot and deputies at Cerne Abbey.&nbsp; (This&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; a long catalogue of recorded immorality there - with </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>local girls</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.)&nbsp; It was finally closed by Sir John Tregownell - on 15 March,</span><span class=rvts4> 1539</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The full break with Rome followed soon after and, by </span><span class=rvts4>1545</span><span class=rvts5>, most of&nbsp; the properties so acquired by the Crown&nbsp; had been&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>re-distributed</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> by Tregonwell and Bartlett, et al&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> often to&nbsp; family and friends).&nbsp; Thus, “in Cerne, all the buildings and lands were eventually Leased out by the Crown to….“…a succession of&nbsp; different people, each of whom sought to make a quick profit.”&nbsp; (ie by quick re-leasing&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>turnovers</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> to other friends and relatives presumably.)&nbsp; It appears that such transfers of Leasehold ownership were too quick and frequent to always be properly recorded and monitored in the associated manor records&nbsp; - with the latter sometimes conveniently misplaced or </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>lost</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, with all the activities that&nbsp; John and Robert Bartlett were no doubt still involved in at this time (including apparently the purchase (and re-sale?) of many other&nbsp; minor properties</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> Leases), one would&nbsp; assume that neither&nbsp; Bartlett would&nbsp; reside at Musto Hall&nbsp; itself (they already having&nbsp; homes in neighbouring Piddleton),&nbsp; nor operate its Farm,&nbsp; but would simply put in or continue with </span><span class=rvts9>a known local Farmer&nbsp; (Yeoman</span><span class=rvts5>) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as a pro-tem Manager (Copyholder).&nbsp;&nbsp; It was our initial understanding that this may, at some </span><span class=rvts13>early</span><span class=rvts5> point, have&nbsp; been&nbsp; our&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (</span><span class=rvts4>1496</span><span class=rvts5>-ca?</span><span class=rvts4>1583</span><span class=rvts5>) and/or&nbsp; his younger sons (William Jnr and/or Richard </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who would&nbsp;&nbsp; both be </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of age</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> by&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1545&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>or</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>so).&nbsp; But, it appears that the</span><span class=rvts9> Lowman family</span><span class=rvts5> already had such roles in Piddlehinton - possibly&nbsp; including Muston,&nbsp; and may havesimply resumed&nbsp; same&nbsp; a little later (post- </span><span class=rvts4>1550, </span><span class=rvts5>say). </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, the question still remains </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> would&nbsp; the Bartlett files </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> said to contain so many instances of the presence of the Churchills interacting with the Bartletts&nbsp; (and&nbsp; those several other families) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; not include&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>something</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts9>confirming:</span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The account of the Bartelot/Bartlett family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s history by Peter Bartlett (given above) included considerable reference to two useful sources of information on Dorset families during&nbsp; the </span><span class=rvts4>1500</span><span class=rvts5>s (as we have noted) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> namely the </span><span class=rvts4>Militia Muster rolls </span><span class=rvts5>and</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>the</span><span class=rvts4> Subsidy Tax rolls</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The names of those&nbsp; recorded&nbsp; on same were taken&nbsp; by Officials on&nbsp; various dates during that century (as well as before and later) and eventually deposited in the Public Record Office (now National Archives).&nbsp;&nbsp; They can be examined there, rather tediously, but thankfully a few have&nbsp; been transcribed and are available elsewhere.&nbsp; One of these - for&nbsp; three&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>Musters&nbsp; held&nbsp; in Dorset</span><span class=rvts5> during the reign of Henry VIII&nbsp; -&nbsp; have at least been&nbsp; gratefully published </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> by one T.L. Stoate&nbsp; of Bristol, in </span><span class=rvts4>1978.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; They have,, most conveniently, also been Indexed there&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> for both the </span><span class=rvts9>Places</span><span class=rvts5> at which these Musters were held and&nbsp; by S</span><span class=rvts9>urnames</span><span class=rvts5> of those listed.&nbsp;&nbsp; [I haven</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t enquired yet whether anything similar has been produced in respect of the Subsidy rolls. (This was later checked; there </span><span class=rvts8>were</span><span class=rvts5> some, but sadly, none for Dorset,&nbsp; as noted thus far).] </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can thus gain a very quick picture of&nbsp; just where&nbsp; members of any given family may have attended such Musters, and thus&nbsp; then resided, in that county. They were&nbsp;&nbsp; designed to determine how many </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Able men</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> were available in the country as a whole&nbsp; (aged 16 to 60)&nbsp; at times of possible conflict, as well as what kinds and amounts of weapons or equipment they possessed.&nbsp; Two of the dates covered were quite close together </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> namely </span><span class=rvts4>1539&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>and&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts4> 1542</span><span class=rvts5>, while the other was for </span><span class=rvts4>1569,</span><span class=rvts5> a&nbsp; generation later.&nbsp;&nbsp; They seem&nbsp; quite thorough but where data may be&nbsp; lacking for one or other&nbsp; of those two earlier years, the other usually provided the&nbsp; missing facts </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> then referred to as the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>alternative</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> roll so&nbsp; used for the above purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the surname of&nbsp; Bartelot,&nbsp; Bartlett, and all similar spellings, we find there were 30&nbsp; entries in Dorset, for one or other of&nbsp; these&nbsp; two earlier Musters, but&nbsp; just 8 for the later one.&nbsp; For the Churchills, there were&nbsp; only 11 entries for the earlier Musters and just 3 for&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1569</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The latter&nbsp; was indeed generally much sparser in coverage. </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My&nbsp; inclination was to examine firstly any Muster entries for Piddleton and Piddlehinton.&nbsp; The entries are organised in terms of </span><span class=rvts9>the Hundreds</span><span class=rvts5> of the county concerned (here Dorset) and within these into their respective Tithings (rather than Manors or Parishes).&nbsp; Thus we find that Piddleton (then Piddletown)&nbsp; was itself the name of a Tithing&nbsp; -&nbsp; within a Hundred of that same name, along with a dozen other such Tithings, while Piddlehinton was classed instead as a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Liberty</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The Muster for&nbsp; that Hundred of Piddleton was taken by&nbsp; George de la Linde and Roger Stourton, Esqs - on September 28/29&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1542</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - for which the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>alternative roll</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> was that&nbsp; taken in </span><span class=rvts4>1539</span><span class=rvts5>, where needed. </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were an amazing 48 different surnames shown for Piddletown in the </span><span class=rvts4>1542</span><span class=rvts5> Muster which, surprisingly, include no Bartletts&nbsp; (however spelt)&nbsp; nor any combined with </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>alias Hancock</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; There were however two shown </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Hancocke</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> itself&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> for a&nbsp; John and Robert.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>alternative roll</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (</span><span class=rvts4>1539</span><span class=rvts5>), there were&nbsp; again no Bartletts,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there were now </span><span class=rvts8>four</span><span class=rvts5> other men listed just as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Hancocke</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; namely, a William, two Richards and a Thomas. </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might reasonably assume that all&nbsp; 6&nbsp; of these </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Hancockes</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; were in fact Bartletts. (as explained in the history above).&nbsp; But, in neither year were&nbsp; there any Churchills&nbsp; in&nbsp; that&nbsp; Tything (reflecting&nbsp; generally the main Piddleton Manor and its&nbsp; surrounding dwellings in that&nbsp; larger parish).&nbsp; In the other&nbsp; 12 Tithings in this Hundred there were at least two other Bartletts noted (spelt thus) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> viz&nbsp; - a William in Milborne St Andrews </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and a Thomas in Tolpuddle </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> both appearing only in&nbsp; their respective </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>alternative rolls</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (for </span><span class=rvts4>1539</span><span class=rvts5>) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> when no Hancockes appeared in either.&nbsp; As noted elsewhere, Milborne was quite near Pulston Manor-&nbsp; at the north end of Charminster.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we find for neighbouring Piddlehinton ?&nbsp; This is, oddly,&nbsp; not in the above Piddleton Hundred&nbsp; (nor any other&nbsp; Hundred),&nbsp; as it was&nbsp; for some reason&nbsp; classed as a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Liberty</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> seemingly a comparable category in its own right (like a small Hundred)&nbsp; -&nbsp; in&nbsp; which were&nbsp; included&nbsp; only two&nbsp; Tythings </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the main one&nbsp; called by that same name </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> which we assume would&nbsp; include Muston Manor and Farm (which however are not mentioned in the slightest in that Muster record) - and a much smaller one called&nbsp; Little Piddle Tything.&nbsp; No Bartletts or Hancocks appear in either,&nbsp; nor Churchills (for either of these two earlier years).&nbsp; This implies that neither family resided there then (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1540</span><span class=rvts5>) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at least with respect to those able-bodies aged 16 to 60).&nbsp; This proviso would apply equally to Piddleton, and to all other results reported in our survey. It seems that the Bartletts (and maybe some Churchills) did not wish their current abodes to be so easily known at&nbsp; that time (ca</span><span class=rvts4> 1540</span><span class=rvts5>) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>when Monestery lnds were being sold off.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There </span><span class=rvts8>were</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; however names William </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Lomyn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> and Henry </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Lomyg</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; listed for&nbsp; Piddlehinton&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1542&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> and&nbsp; also a Thomas and George Lomyn in </span><span class=rvts4>1539</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - (when Henry was listed as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Loman</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.)&nbsp; We take these all to be </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Lowman</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> as generally depicted&nbsp; in the</span><span class=rvts8> Piddlehinton </span><span class=rvts4>Manor Court</span><span class=rvts5> records&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> seen at Eton </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> for these and other years in the Tudor period </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; post-</span><span class=rvts4>1535</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The latter&nbsp; records also did not include anything for Muston Manor </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>in whatever Tything or Liberty it may or may not&nbsp; have then&nbsp; been considered a part.&nbsp; Its pre-</span><span class=rvts4>1535</span><span class=rvts5> records may have remained wherever those for Cerne Abbey or Christchurch Abbey ended up and those for its </span><span class=rvts4>post-1535</span><span class=rvts5> history should have been transferred with its changing ownership Deeds&nbsp; -&nbsp; from the Bartletts in </span><span class=rvts4>1545</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; until the </span><span class=rvts8>Dorchester</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; Churchills </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> after </span><span class=rvts4>1610</span><span class=rvts5> or so,&nbsp; with many other names between.&nbsp; The earlier </span><span class=rvts8>Bradford Peverell</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; Churchills </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in the early to mid-1</span><span class=rvts4>500</span><span class=rvts5>s - (as Roger and his son Mathew; or even Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father William Churchill Snr) appear thus far not to have been directly involved with Muston manor (in Piddlehinton&nbsp; Tything (or parish)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; whatever its Freehold, Leasehold or&nbsp; Copyhold&nbsp; condition&nbsp; at the time </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at least as depicted in the&nbsp; described Muster records.&nbsp; One also noted no Colliers/Collyers there then either. </span></p>

The next Tything shown in this Hundred&nbsp; (after those two)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>was that of </span><span class=rvts13>Polyston</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> also known as </span><span class=rvts4>Pulston Manor</span><span class=rvts5> (on the river Cerne)&nbsp; in upper Charminster parish) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; at its north-eastern tip.&nbsp; Intriguingly, two men appearing for the muster for that small manor then (</span><span class=rvts4>1542</span><span class=rvts5>) were a &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts3>Robert Bartlett</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>and</span><span class=rvts5> a </span><span class=rvts11>William</span><span class=rvts3> Churchill.</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Intriguingly</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>because we find that immediately to the east of this small manor and farm is a large stretch of sheep pasture land which extends into something called </span><span class=rvts3>Muston Down</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>-,ie a thin-soiled uplands pasture on chalk useful mainly for sheep grazing, with no other farm, hamlet or&nbsp; village settlements in that direction - until one&nbsp; gets to the next&nbsp; Manor eastward </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> namely </span><span class=rvts4>Muston Manor</span><span class=rvts5> (!)&nbsp; in the next valley - on the Piddle&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>river-system</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> about an hour</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s walk away at most.&nbsp; </span></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could this William Churchill of Pulston&nbsp; be the &nbsp; William Churchill whom Winston understood had settled onto a Dorset manor then wrongly believed was called Manston&nbsp; or Munston,&nbsp; or something like that</span> ?&nbsp; Or, did he confuse the two branches&nbsp; of the Churchills, only one of which was clearly associated with Muston  ca 1610-20, say, with the other settled rather earlier in&nbsp; Bradford Peverell or just next door in Charminster,   with its Pulston Manor ?</span></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the latter then called Polyston and the former Musterton, or Mustone or whatever ?&nbsp; Names and spelling were in considerable flux then.&nbsp;&nbsp;  There was likely  some vague awareness of Muston in any case - from Winston apparently knowing&nbsp; a little about the  later Dorchester family</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; having&nbsp; a connection with some such&nbsp; Manor - in that general region. There is no reason not to assume that our&nbsp; otherwise missing William Churchill Snr, father of Roger and John (and others),  would not be </span><span class=rvts8>that</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> clearly then of&nbsp; nearby </span><span class=rvts4>Pulston Manor, &nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> in </span><span class=rvts4>1542</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if and until shown elsewhere. &nbsp; The only other William Churchill extant at that time resided in Dorchester </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at Colliton House </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who would have no reason to&nbsp; reside at Pulston then </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> being either too young or otherwise occupied in his role in town. One has increasingly concluded that any seeming association of Roger and John Churchill </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> via their immediate forefather - (unknown to&nbsp; Winston)&nbsp; -&nbsp; with the Munston/Muston manor,&nbsp; most likely arose&nbsp; due to his uncertainty over&nbsp; the relevant generations</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> names, places&nbsp; and&nbsp; timings.&nbsp; It was, seemingly,&nbsp; rather cloudy in his memory and &nbsp;  understanding. </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ In any case, we must mention here that we have alluded several times above to this possibility of Pulston manor being relevant in our hunt for this elder William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s residence&nbsp; around this period </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> without citing our source (as above). This only arose once we had checked those&nbsp; Muster Rolls&nbsp; more latterly&nbsp; - but inserted the resultant possibility once so discovered and confirmed  &nbsp; and thus not placed into our </span><span class=rvts8>earlier text</span><span class=rvts5> concerning Muston. &nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is just possible that said William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s younger son William Jnr (born as early as ca </span><span class=rvts4>1525</span><span class=rvts5>, say,&nbsp; could be on one side or the other of the lower age limit for&nbsp; mustering in </span><span class=rvts4>1542</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; His&nbsp; next son Richard would more likely have been a little&nbsp; too young (but these are guesses).&nbsp;&nbsp; One wonders if there were any surviving parish church registers for this manor, or would the relevant events only be registered with&nbsp; those for&nbsp; Charminster church </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> where the death (and/or burial) of William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s daughter-in-law Jane was oddly later&nbsp; registered - in </span><span class=rvts4>1577 </span><span class=rvts5>?&nbsp;&nbsp; All rather intriguing but hopeful.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, we examine next the Muster for </span><span class=rvts4>Little Bredy</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; to where the index has also pointed us </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ie with&nbsp; some&nbsp; Churchill listings.&nbsp; We find there in fact </span><span class=rvts8>two</span><span class=rvts5> Churchills </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> another </span><span class=rvts4>William (!),&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> and a Richard !&nbsp; These could be said William Snr</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s next two sons (born later than Roger or John).&nbsp;&nbsp; And, interestingly, we find&nbsp; four&nbsp; members of the Martyn fzmily </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Thomas, John, Nicholas and&nbsp; Richard&nbsp; residing there as well !?&nbsp; The first two listed had the full range of equipment, including a horse each.&nbsp; We may remind ourselves of the comments so often made in the&nbsp; Bartlett history&nbsp; of&nbsp; the remarkable numbers of times the families of Bartlett, Churchill, Martyn, Kellaway&nbsp; and&nbsp; Freke or Tregonwell&nbsp; occur together in various parishes and manor documents&nbsp; at this time (without any explicit basis&nbsp; suggested for same - but the influence of John </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Bartelot alias Hancocke</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; could conceivably have taken various&nbsp; forms -from slight to major.&nbsp;&nbsp; These two Churchills could well be the younger sons of the William Churchill of&nbsp; Pulston Manor (or, with respect to the Williams, at least, even vice versa) ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, one will be interested to learn&nbsp; if there are any early&nbsp; church registers still extant for this small parish; or Subsidy Tax evidence.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [As noted, we can infer no particular hypotheses as to how, if at all, the common presence of those with these same 3 or 4 surnames can be accounted for. It would seem however not too unlikely, in light of comments proferred in the Bartlett history,&nbsp; that the Bartletts (and possibly the Martyns) would&nbsp; be in positions to help the Churchills, and others,&nbsp; in ways that are less than&nbsp; simply granting them full property rights or very reasonable sales prices. Leaseholds would seem a likey choice. There may&nbsp; also have been some&nbsp; inter-marriage of course.&nbsp; Those facilitating any such advantages&nbsp; would likely have benefitted&nbsp; equally themselves.&nbsp; This same scenario would seem to be relevant&nbsp; with respect&nbsp; to other&nbsp; parishes and manors&nbsp; to be described below.] </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving Little Bredy, we should note that in&nbsp; the Index for Chancery Proceedings&nbsp; it was noticed&nbsp; that there was a case (C3/ xxxx) regarding property there&nbsp; in which the Complainant&nbsp; was a widow&nbsp; of one Phillip Van ……….&nbsp; - her&nbsp; maiden name&nbsp; unrevealed)&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Defendants were&nbsp; …… Myller, William Churchill and Richard Bonde.&nbsp; Sadly, no date was shown </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> other than again&nbsp; being somewhere between </span><span class=rvts4>1553</span><span class=rvts5> and </span><span class=rvts4>1603</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The later the actual date for the case, the&nbsp; more likely the William Churchill concerned would be he of&nbsp; Dorchester (</span><span class=rvts4>1541-1601</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; - not aged 21+, ay, until ca </span><span class=rvts4>1562+&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> rather than his apparent grandfather&nbsp; (</span><span class=rvts4>1496-1570+</span><span class=rvts5>), or that man</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s third son </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> both William Churchills (Snr and Jnr) .&nbsp; But, he wouldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t have been either of those latter two Williams of&nbsp; the earlier Little Bredy </span><span class=rvts8>musters</span><span class=rvts5> either - as the younger Dorchester man was only born about&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1541</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We must enquire therefore what might be any common denominator as between the earlier and&nbsp; the later&nbsp; William Churchill&nbsp; associated with&nbsp; Lt Bredy ?&nbsp;&nbsp; (Mellers and Bondes</span><span class=rvts8> were</span><span class=rvts5> of course more likely associated&nbsp; with the significantly</span><span class=rvts8> later</span><span class=rvts5> Dorchester family.) </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two factors that could be relevant in this regard:&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) the later William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s son John married&nbsp; Eleanor, a daughter of John Meller&nbsp; by then&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>of Lt Bredy</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> ( the surname of one of the Defendants)&nbsp; and (2) I have seen reference to&nbsp; Cerne Abbey having property interests in both the Cerne valley manors (including Pulston)&nbsp; and even in Muston (in neighbouring Piddle valley)&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts9>as well as in (more distant)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts3>Lt Bredy</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>(and</span><span class=rvts4> Long Bredy </span><span class=rvts5>next door</span><span class=rvts4>) !</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; And, that property sold with Muston was even further afield </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> near Cranborne - much to the east.&nbsp;&nbsp; These aspects could all be linked&nbsp; OR,&nbsp; it is possible that it was only a coincidence and&nbsp; that William Churchill of Dorchester</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s concern related </span><span class=rvts8>only</span><span class=rvts5> to the Meller and/or Bond links - later.&nbsp;&nbsp; The presence of the elder&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts8> </span><span class=rvts5>William Churchill or family at Lt Bredy </span><span class=rvts8>may</span><span class=rvts5> have simply been a coincidence&nbsp; - of&nbsp; which the Dorchester William&nbsp;&nbsp; may himself&nbsp; never have been aware.&nbsp; If&nbsp; it&nbsp; wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t, there could well be reference in the details of that C3/ case indicating some family connection between these&nbsp; two Williams (and a common property interest </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> quickly turned around)&nbsp; rather than it being due entirely to the Meller link, and to </span><span class=rvts8>their</span><span class=rvts5> earlier property there (or, was it not</span><span class=rvts8> that</span><span class=rvts5> early) !?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We look next at the Dorchester musters themselves where the expected elder John Churchill (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1520-1557</span><span class=rvts5>), the foregoing younger William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father, and his possible&nbsp; brother-in-law John Bond both&nbsp; appear -&nbsp; in St Peter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s parish - the former with the full kit, as it were.&nbsp; There were no Churchills in same nor in the other&nbsp; two Dorchester parishes, nor were&nbsp; any Martyns or Bartletts&nbsp; apparent in these Dorchester&nbsp; (town) musters either. Many families preferred the quieter Manorial life of the countryside,&nbsp; if not involved in commerce or the ambitions of local public office. They avoided Dorchester.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now return north of Dorchester again but a little to the&nbsp; north-west&nbsp; of Pulston manor (and of its more northerly neighbours Forston and Godmanston)&nbsp;&nbsp; to consider Frampton&nbsp; Tything&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> home latterly of&nbsp; a very wealthy&nbsp; family -&nbsp; the Brownes (but previously held by the……….. s and/or a religious order&nbsp; (?Cerne) but&nbsp; was bought out by this former and successful Yeoman family of Browne; (whether they too&nbsp; profited by knowing the Bartletts in obtaining that property is yet to be investigated).&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, the first entry is for the then head of that huge household (and Manor)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>John Browne, Esq&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who sports no less than </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>5 Harnesses furnished,&nbsp; 5 Bills&nbsp; and Bows,&nbsp; and Arrow sheaves to match. But, more to our own point, the turnout&nbsp; there included a </span><span class=rvts4>John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; as well as Robert Bartletts, Snr and Jnr, John Bartletts,&nbsp; Snr and Jnr,&nbsp; and&nbsp; a William Bartlett, - as well as&nbsp; William and Thomas Martyns !?!&nbsp; There will be descriptions later of some connection between the Frampton Bartletts and those later in the Somerset branch. What </span><span class=rvts13>was</span><span class=rvts5> the common denominator here ? </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another Tything displaying a similar range of these family names was Compton Valence (in Compton Tything) where there was</span><span class=rvts8> another</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>, accompanied this time by&nbsp; a John, Henry, Richard, Robert and William Bartlett !&nbsp;&nbsp; It was as though when&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>John Bartlett alias Hancocke</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> was sharing his bounty or influence around (in whatever form),&nbsp; it went to his own relatives (including cousins) </span><span class=rvts8>and</span><span class=rvts5> to those of&nbsp; his Churchill and Martyn friends (or cousins!)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in </span><span class=rvts9>several</span><span class=rvts5> locations -&nbsp; probably at levels below actual Freehold grants, purchase&nbsp; or reduced rents </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but rather , as temporary Leaseholds&nbsp; - often to be&nbsp; sold on.&nbsp;&nbsp; [It may well be instructive to&nbsp;&nbsp; inspect all those Crown property&nbsp; transaction details which Peter Bartlett said were </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>simply too voluminous</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> to include in his&nbsp; own history itself;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ie&nbsp; see eg National Archive record&nbsp;&nbsp; Class E 310-390, etc). </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5> <center> ---&nbsp; ---&nbsp; ---&nbsp; ---&nbsp; ---</center></span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our various discoveries regarding the Churchills</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> places of residence in Dorset -&nbsp;&nbsp; before and after </span><span class=rvts4>1550</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - clearly leads to more questions than answers.&nbsp; But, we do have the statement that Muston manor </span><span class=rvts13>was</span><span class=rvts5> held by the (earlier?) Churchills - by Leasehold&nbsp; (ca mid-century) ; that is,&nbsp; seemingly </span><span class=rvts8>before</span><span class=rvts5> some later Dorchester&nbsp; Churchill&nbsp; purchased the Freehold outright from ca </span><span class=rvts4>1586</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts4>1612) </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>possibly piecemeal</span><span class=rvts4>.&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; We also rely heavily on the&nbsp; likely reason why a Churchill bought Louvard fields in the first place - in </span><span class=rvts4>1586</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of all possible rural property then available&nbsp; in&nbsp; Dorset.&nbsp; Surely it was because a very significant </span><span class=rvts8>earlier</span><span class=rvts5> Churchill (?progenitor) had been long connected with Muston manor immediately next door.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also now have evidence of&nbsp; the presence of a </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> in a neighbouring Manor </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>in </span><span class=rvts4>Pulston</span><span class=rvts5> - in </span><span class=rvts4>1542 </span><span class=rvts5>(with a Robt Bartlett also residing there </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> wishing to avoid Piddleton?</span><span class=rvts4>) ,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> as well as copious evidence of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>other</span><span class=rvts5> Churchills, including a William&nbsp;&nbsp; outside of&nbsp; of Dorchester).&nbsp;&nbsp; What&nbsp; we do lack&nbsp; is a clearer picture of the lines of descent of all the&nbsp; those contemporary Churchills and Bartletts so discovered !</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>And</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>still nothing on </span><span class=rvts4>Roger Churchill </span><span class=rvts5>from all this data.</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>Was he in Sherborne latterly&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in hospital ?</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>Hopefully, more Subsidy tax and Church Register data&nbsp; will one day help clarify these matters.&nbsp; Being in Charminster parish, one would assume that there should be&nbsp; some parish church entries recorded for r any early residents of Pulston </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at some point. There </span><span class=rvts8>are</span><span class=rvts5> early manor court records extant for Pulston </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but they oddly cease around </span><span class=rvts4>1477</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Was Cerne Abbey&nbsp; or the  Wars of the Roses of relevance ?&nbsp; There are, I believe, one or two PRO documents&nbsp; of&nbsp; possible interest.</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5></span><span class=rvts4>CHAPTER 19</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4></span><span class=rvts3>A BRIEF RESUME ON DOIRSET </span></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue from the several&nbsp; married Churchill couples eventually residing in the Dorchester area from ca </span><span class=rvts4>1540</span><span class=rvts5> (or before) had thus grown&nbsp; apace and documentary evidence concerning them could&nbsp; easily become&nbsp; confused&nbsp; - regarding the inter-relationships of their respective branches and&nbsp; origins, </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with so many Johns, Williams and Jaspers, etc.&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>Some</span><span class=rvts5> assistance only&nbsp; in this&nbsp; was provided by the issuing&nbsp; of the </span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Colliton Pedigree</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> for details on&nbsp; those&nbsp; local, inter-related&nbsp; Churchills </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> essentially of the wider Dorchester area. They were,&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>seemingly,</span><span class=rvts5> all</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>descended from </span><span class=rvts9>William - the Yeoman of&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>Rockbeare </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> (and, we believe,&nbsp; later temporarily of Muston and/or Pulston&nbsp; nearby)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as we understood.&nbsp; In theory, they could have been associated earlier (pre-</span><span class=rvts4>1530)&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>with&nbsp; Rockbeare, Colyton (in Devon) and Catherston (in </span><span class=rvts8>west</span><span class=rvts5> Dorset),</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>and later with&nbsp; Bradford Peverell, Dorchester, Muston, Pulston&nbsp; and Corton&nbsp; - if more easterly in south central Dorset.&nbsp; Sadly, several of these parishes have no surviving early registers before </span><span class=rvts4>1570&nbsp; - </span><span class=rvts5>to confirm or even establish their situations in this regard.&nbsp; Property litigations or conveyance may prove more useful.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The status of the Churchill and&nbsp; Peverell families were allegedly included </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but seemingly in a rather&nbsp; partial or incomplete form.&nbsp; That for the Churchills was provided solely by the above </span><span class=rvts4>William Churchill </span><span class=rvts5>of Dorchester, and signed by him.&nbsp; It is oddly restricted&nbsp; essentially to&nbsp; that shown on the Colliton pedigrees&nbsp; and had&nbsp; little if anything to, say about Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s line of&nbsp; Mathew, Jasper as members of the main Churchill descent proceeding&nbsp; directly to&nbsp; John, Duke of Marlborough. via John and Winston of Wooton Glanville etc.&nbsp; Some had of course moved on </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to London.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Visitation account (so contributed by William Churchill of Dorchester)&nbsp; again&nbsp; begins&nbsp; in mid-air as it were -&nbsp; with&nbsp; the earlier John Churchill of Dorchester (d. </span><span class=rvts4>1557</span><span class=rvts5>) appearing as from nowhere. Nothing is&nbsp; mentioned or alluded about his&nbsp; possible father </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the earlier William Churchill&nbsp; - nor of the later John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s apparently older brother Roger (by then long dead), or his parallel issue initially in Dorset, and later in London.&nbsp; The family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Coat of Arms </span><span class=rvts8>was</span><span class=rvts5> mentioned -&nbsp; described verbally.&nbsp; Some descendants, after Roger,&nbsp; Mathew, and Jasper Snr did reside at times in London but I</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>m not certain if there were comparable Visitations for same </span><span class=rvts8>in those years</span><span class=rvts5>; if so, they seem to be very incomplete.

I believe.]&nbsp; Many political families from the provinces resided part-time in Westminster.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Peverells, there were a few first names given for Dorset)&nbsp; but no dates or relationships.&nbsp; It did show a very brief entry -&nbsp; simply:&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Jane===Megges</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (provided by whom?)&nbsp; and the name Nicholas Megges appeared just once, elsewhere,&nbsp; but, again, without&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>any</span><span class=rvts5> accompanying dates, places, relationships or Coats of Arms.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps20><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If some of the foregoing describes&nbsp; the family situation and events&nbsp; in&nbsp; Dorchester at least - for those&nbsp; descended from the possible Yeoman</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s seeming second son John Snr, who had settled there, we enquire also about any issue from Roger, and from William Jnr,&nbsp; respectively </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ie John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s next two immediate brothers (as understood).&nbsp; As noted, we</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>ve concluded that Roger (b ca </span><span class=rvts4>1518</span><span class=rvts5>) married Jane Peverell (b ca </span><span class=rvts4>1518-20</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; about&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1538-42&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> and had a first surviving son </span><span class=rvts4>Mathew Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>, possibly in Bradford Peverell (if not in Sherborne) soon after, (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1544-47</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; Jane would strongly appear to have then married, </span><span class=rvts9>only </span><span class=rvts15>secondly</span><span class=rvts5>, Nicholas Megges </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; after </span><span class=rvts4>1552 </span><span class=rvts5>or so. - with their&nbsp; first born, Lawrence, generally shown as born </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts8>about</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>1553</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4>. </span><span class=rvts5>They had no others.</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>Some or all of</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> these</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>events quite possibly occurred in Bradford Peverell whose early registers sadly do not survive (why?).&nbsp; Bishop</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Transcripts are of little use as they were also too late in appearing on the scene. </span></p>
<p class=rvps20><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other&nbsp; brother William of this generation (ie as the Yeoman</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s apparent third son)&nbsp; is thought to&nbsp; have been born about </span><span class=rvts4>1525 </span><span class=rvts5>or so</span><span class=rvts4>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> but we can see none of that name still living&nbsp; at the time of second brother John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1557 </span><span class=rvts5>Will;&nbsp; although we do find that a&nbsp; previously unrealised brother </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Rowland</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4> Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; surprisingly mentioned; but there appears to be no&nbsp; prior or later evidence&nbsp; of this man</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; existence, or where he fitted into the sequence of births of his assumed siblings. Any information regarding his origins&nbsp; would obviously assist our understanding.&nbsp; Nor is Roger mentioned in that Will, but more&nbsp; understandably&nbsp; as he&nbsp; had&nbsp; died&nbsp; about 5 years before&nbsp; John&nbsp; wrote&nbsp; it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other possible brothers Richard and Alexander (seemingly born later- ca </span><span class=rvts4>1530-35</span><span class=rvts5>, say) have also been mentioned.&nbsp; Thus, a </span><span class=rvts4>Richard Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> is noted&nbsp; as one of the&nbsp; Overseers to John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Will of </span><span class=rvts4>1557</span><span class=rvts5>; where else could he have appeared from ? And an Alexander is mentioned once or twice elsewhere </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> currently misplaced.&nbsp; And Rowland.</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should note that after our reference to the Will of&nbsp; John Churchill 1 of Dorchester (c</span><span class=rvts4>1522 -1557</span><span class=rvts5>), there have been&nbsp; many noteworthy and prominent members of that one branch of the family subsequently who continued to serve in local and national positions (mentioned above). We have&nbsp; described these briefly&nbsp; before continuing with our primary goal </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of delineating their cousin line </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as descended in parallel&nbsp; from John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s brother </span><span class=rvts4>Roger Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> (ca </span><span class=rvts4>1520 - ca 1552</span><span class=rvts5>) - via Mathew and Jasper Churchill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both&nbsp; of&nbsp; Roger</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; dates&nbsp; are estimates&nbsp; based on circumstantial evidence. They suggest that Roger&nbsp; could have been considering marriage from around </span><span class=rvts4>1538&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> - when he would be about 18&nbsp; or so.&nbsp; Who knew, in the </span><span class=rvts4>1530</span><span class=rvts5>s, say, about Jane Peverell being a sole heiress to a deceased father </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> William Peverell </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of Dorset ?&nbsp; Is Sherborne relevant ?&nbsp; I have seen reference to William being from </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Bardolfeston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> intriguingly just east of&nbsp; Piddleton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was Roger there ca </span><span class=rvts4>1542 </span><span class=rvts5>?</span></p>
<p class=rvps18><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We noted (somewhere)&nbsp; that a start was apparently&nbsp; made in transferring the Freehold ownership of the Muston property, from the Bartletts&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Churchills, as early as the&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1560</span><span class=rvts5>s (details sadly misplaced), although for whatever reason this (intended early transfer)&nbsp; wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t finalised until </span><span class=rvts4>1612 </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>after various intervening overtures.&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>By this date,</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>both William the Yeoman and his elder sons Roger and&nbsp; John had died </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; Roger about </span><span class=rvts4>1552 </span><span class=rvts5>(oddly leaving no surviving Will or Administration</span><span class=rvts4>)&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> and John in </span><span class=rvts4>1557</span><span class=rvts5> (leaving a Will) and their aged father apparently (or allegedly) not&nbsp; dying until </span><span class=rvts4>1583</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; aged an impressive 93 - but again leaving no Will. </span></p>

At both national and county level, these most respected, often inter-married, families </span><span class=rvts8>were all well know to one another</span><span class=rvts5>; their forebears for many generations had been carefully scrutinised, and their wealth generally accounted for in terms of property, ability, ancient lineage </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and reliable loyalty to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the system</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; (ie </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the establishment').&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts26>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>Many like Winston Churchill had remained loyal through very difficult times and Charles II, after his return,&nbsp; sought to make amends as best he could with a depleted treasury.&nbsp; This was. ironically,&nbsp; at least augmented by funds from France&nbsp; - to ensure England</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s continued support in her grander plans for Europe. The new English parliament was thus stocked with the often young sons of those loyal adherents so had to remain for some time (18 years in a single </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>long parliament</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>!)&nbsp; as they matured with increasing experience - for which Charles II said he was </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>quite patient to await</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, he had to compensate many families who had lost their estates </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> both in England and Ireland.&nbsp; Winston was an active MP in these regards during</span><span class=rvts4> 1660</span><span class=rvts5> and </span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4>61</span><span class=rvts5>, as well as later dealing with the House of Lords in promoting their cooperation in establishing a renewed Army (as reported May 10, </span><span class=rvts4>1662</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; But the settlements of many grievances in Ireland at that time (then a full member of the Union) was being clogged up by countless difficulties and the initial committee of 36 men set up to resolve them was disbanded (having too many personal interests in Ireland themselves)&nbsp; and a new one chosen by the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s chief advisers </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> composed of just 7 men of known integrity and competence -&nbsp; replaced them in over-seeing this </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Court of Claims</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Winston Churchill was one of those chosen 7 </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> possibly effected through the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>good offices</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> of an important friend in high places - one Sir Henry Bennett, later Lord Arlington, whose influence had first ecured his introduction to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the Court</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> in Whitehall</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> and who would continue to be influential with both the Court and&nbsp; Parliament in future. </span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston thus moved with his family to Dublin&nbsp; in July</span><span class=rvts4> 1662</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Son John was just 12 and so in need of more formal schooling.&nbsp; He was soon admitted to Dublin</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Free Grammar School</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> where he would obtain a quite adequate early education for the next two years.&nbsp; But, by December </span><span class=rvts4>1663</span><span class=rvts5>, Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s committee complained of the slow progress, frustration&nbsp; and utter fatigue being experienced.&nbsp; He wrote to Lord Arlington asking if he could possibly return home for a&nbsp; two months&nbsp; break - for a well needed rest.&nbsp; This was not only granted but, once home, he was given a new position in the Royal Household (on the Board of Green Cloth) which oversees placement of staff in same) and, in addition, received a knighthood - in January </span><span class=rvts4>1664</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Young John Churchill would soon be 14.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I first scanned </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Marlborough</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, His Life and Times</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, I noticed some reference to John Churchill gaining an early place as an army Ensign - through some such contact </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>at Court</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> and thought it odd that the foundation to his later military and diplomatic success hadn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t been (in part at least) by way of some more favoured </span><span class=rvts4>educational</span><span class=rvts5> background&nbsp; -&nbsp; something generally denied to the vast bulk of young people in those times.&nbsp; When it appeared later that it wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t as a</span><span class=rvts8> military</span><span class=rvts5> Ensign initially but as a </span><span class=rvts8>cour</span><span class=rvts5>t Page through which he first got a foot in the Royal door, that educational advantage still seemed oddly lacking.&nbsp; However, we find that the timing of the return to London for Winston and family, with his new position and honour, would prove most fortuitous. For 14 year old John Churchill soon obtained a place&nbsp; at St Paul</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s School, one of the best of the few </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Public Schools</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; already well established in :London.&nbsp; A house was&nbsp; thus soon purchased in the City within walking distance of the school where he was a&nbsp; day pupil for the next two or three important years.&nbsp; Odd&nbsp; to think that a Jasper Churchill, described ca </span><span class=rvts4>1665-70</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; as being of </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>The Strand</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> so nearby, (and shortly to be the subject effectively of an Inquisition post mortem) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> was someone of whose existence or relevance young John Churchill may or may not have&nbsp; been aware&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Ships in the night</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of different generations. </span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s first born and John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s older sister, Atrabella, had, a little before this, turned 16 (in </span><span class=rvts4>1665</span><span class=rvts5>) and the role of patronage would again come to the rescue.&nbsp; The wife of James, Duke of York (the Duchess), needed another </span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>maid of honour</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> in her personal household and the position was offered to and accepted by Arabella (and by her parents).&nbsp; It was recognised as a major placement of influence and security for her and her family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s future.&nbsp; It was not long before the Duke (the future King James II) took affectionate note of Arabella</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; beauty and figure.&nbsp; If her brother was at all concerned for her </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>honour</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; as some apparently implied later that&nbsp; he should possibly have been, it was pointed out by John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s future wife Sarah Churchill (many years later) that as a school boy at the time, </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>still being whipped for not reading his book</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; there was nothing he could possibly have done about it, had he wanted&nbsp; to.&nbsp; As it transpired therefore, Arabella would, after </span><span class=rvts4>1668</span><span class=rvts5> or so) become the Duke</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s favoured mistress and would bear that&nbsp; future King a son -&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>James Fitz-James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (amongst others), who became Duke of Berwick, a Marshall of France and a military victor on his own account </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as at the battle of Almanza.&nbsp; In any case,Arabella later married very well herself.</span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morality of these arrangements at that level of society then was more than simply tolerated, it was an accepted reality of life and actively sought after.&nbsp; The Kings</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> wives were, after all, all chosen politically to bear heirs and solidify allegiances. They may not necessarily have been particularly </span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>pliant and warm</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>wives (say).&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By </span><span class=rvts4>1666</span><span class=rvts5>, Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s trusted services were again required in Ireland however - to continue the commission</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s remit to resolve the issues of property claims there.&nbsp; He decided to return their without the family, who continued living in London.&nbsp; John had reached a point at 16 when he would have to consider his own future.&nbsp; Many young gentlemen of adequate education would enter one of the Inns of Court at about that point (often at 18) for legal training </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if only to better handle the affairs of any inherited estates to come, or to become a fully practising lawyer, as did his grandfather&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and/or enter one of the two universities&nbsp; of Oxford or Cambridge </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> generally to prepare for a position in the church.&nbsp; But, again, with the advantage of Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s patron Lord Arlington*, that position in the Court with the Duke of York </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as a Page - was soon provided.&nbsp; The future potential advantages of this were apparently considered superior to those other two alternatives and it was thus taken up that same year. </span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; [ * It would seem relevant to determine the basis of this important early friendship and patronage - between Winston and the former Sir Henry Bennett; later, as Lord Arlington, he would prove a most important and pivotal ally and power broker.)</span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Winston continued in Dublin until </span><span class=rvts4>1669</span><span class=rvts5> including a phase there when he became rather frustrated in coping with agents of&nbsp; his children</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s patron, the Duke of York, who kept seeking control of Irish properties allegedly promised to them&nbsp; by the King - formerly owned by some of those responsible for the execution of their father Charles I in </span><span class=rvts4>1649</span><span class=rvts5> !&nbsp; He felt that they were however often over-stepping the mark and told them so.&nbsp; But the Duke was seemingly so pleased with Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s qualities otherwise, and those of his children, in his and his wife</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s service, this was soon ignored.&nbsp; Indeed, on one occasion, the Duke, who was much involved with his role in maintaining the fitness and competence of both the Army and Navy asked young John Churchill one day where he saw his future.&nbsp;&nbsp; John replied instantly that he would very much like to gain entry into one of </span><span class=rvts8>the senior army Regiments</span><span class=rvts5>. We should recall that his own father had been a Cavalier Captain serving the previous King; despite earlier law qualifications. John would have heard many stories of his action in the recent war.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, he was apparently an active, energetic lad who would be less content in any indoor role </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as in the law.&nbsp; He duly became an Ensign in the Army (in the Life Guards regiment)&nbsp; by </span><span class=rvts4>1668&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> - as a first step in this chosen path, then aged about 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to this decision and its immediate consequences, we may note that while still a Page at the Court, ,he already had some influence and useful contacts&nbsp; there - by virtue of three well placed ladies.&nbsp; His sister was, as noted,&nbsp; a Maid of Honour to the Duchess of York and a confidante of the Duke (the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s brother) while his 2</span><span class=rvts16>nd</span><span class=rvts5> cousin, once removed, Barbara nee Villiers, had become the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s first&nbsp; mistress. (The Villiers had been close to&nbsp; royal families for some generations.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, this latter lady had a close friend in John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s aunt&nbsp; (his mother</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s sister) of the Drake family </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> seemingly also well acquainted with royalty.&nbsp; John would have met them all when visiting his aunt or in Barbara</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s own rooms at the Palace.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was about 8 years older than still young John Churchill and had already borne the King, who remained infatuated with her for many years, 5 children before she was 25.&nbsp; Initially, she treated John as one would a young cousin she saw from time to time in the company of her best friend, John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s aunt.&nbsp; Once set on his career in the Army, John appeared at Court less often but did know many people there and no doubt showed up at times&nbsp; in his smart new uniforms.</span></p>
<p class=rvps20><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such young future officers were expected to gain some foreign experience in the services and he soon volunteered for a posting with his regiment to Tangiers </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> held by the British through some agreement with Spain as an outpost from which to control Algerian pirates, on their </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Corsairs</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, interfering with British shipping in the Mediterranean.&nbsp;&nbsp; He stayed there an impressive 2 ½&nbsp; years </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts4>1670</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> entailing some active fighting experience as Tangiers was frequently attacked .&nbsp; He did not return home directly, however, as his services were still needed in a naval capacity searching out those pirates elsewhere in the Mediterranean and in an attack on their headquarters in Algiers.&nbsp;&nbsp; He thus gained further&nbsp; experience as a young&nbsp; officer at sea, engaging in such actions, for some months.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps20><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He seems to have arrived back home in January </span><span class=rvts4>1671</span><span class=rvts5> and was soon being admired by all the ladies of the Court in his latest uniform, bronze tanned&nbsp; and with&nbsp; stories of his adventures, not least by Barbara Villiers, now 29 to John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s 21.&nbsp; The strong attraction was mutual.&nbsp; Between </span><span class=rvts4>1671 </span><span class=rvts5>and</span><span class=rvts4> 1675</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts8> before</span><span class=rvts5> he met his future wife Sarah Jennings, John Churchill was Barbara Villiers</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> sole lover.&nbsp; She had been created Duchess of Cleveland and&nbsp; was independently very well&nbsp; off herself.&nbsp; Her affair with the King was now over and completely dormant and she bore just one more child, a daughter&nbsp; - for whom John was the acknowledged putative father.&nbsp; There is no suspicion that he ever had any other affairs or loves after subsequently meeting Sarah - when he was 24 - to whom&nbsp; it is generally agreed he was totally devoted, as she was to him, for the rest of their lives. This was universally recognised,&nbsp; admired. and&nbsp; unquestioned.</span></p>
<p class=rvps24><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are just two or three recorded snippets of information by which we may monitor John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s non-military life during those 4 socially indulgent years (</span><span class=rvts4>1671-</span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>75</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; Thus, he was reported in some Gazette of the times that he was involved in two separate duels, being injured in the arm in one.&nbsp; They occurred in early and late </span><span class=rvts4>1671</span><span class=rvts5>, against a Mr. Fenwick and a&nbsp; Mr Herbert,&nbsp; respectively.&nbsp; The subject of the challenges and by whom is not given.&nbsp; It may reflect our understanding of John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s adventurous and risk-taking nature.&nbsp; The other item has a less confirmed character but was a generally understood occurrence a little later </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> around </span><span class=rvts4>1673</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> pertaining to his sudden departure from Barbara</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s apartments one evening as the King was approaching and, to save her embarrassment, he jumped successfully down to a courtyard below.&nbsp; In appreciation, she allegedly provided him with a £5000. reward </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; knowing in any case that he had recently extolled to her the benefits of a potential investment in&nbsp; a form of Life insurance Annuity then being promoted&nbsp; by Lord Halifax </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> an acknowledged honourable man.&nbsp; A sum of £4,500 would guarantee a later&nbsp; annuity for life worth £500. a year.&nbsp; (One could live comfortably on £50 at that time.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He so invested (on 30 April </span><span class=rvts4>1674</span><span class=rvts5>) and did benefit from same reliably over many future years such that some say it was the&nbsp; foundation of his&nbsp; family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s later&nbsp; fortune and wealth.&nbsp; [One mustn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t forget that at that time , another Churchiill, (Jasper 3) was (independently) becoming very wealthy&nbsp; himself.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this 4 year period in his early 20s, John would also have continued gaining in experience with his Regiment (the Life Guards) in various&nbsp; manoeuvres and actions </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at home and abroad. </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> when not advancing his contacts socially with all and sundry around Court (at St James Palace) and Whitehall (government) circles.&nbsp;&nbsp; More active military experience was&nbsp; thus provided, in </span><span class=rvts4>1672</span><span class=rvts5>, just after his 22</span><span class=rvts16>nd</span><span class=rvts5> birthday.&nbsp; This action, the first since Tangiers, was seemingly a rather minor affair. to be described below .but only after first putting into context the entire complex situation in Europe at that time.&nbsp; This entailed a masterful summation by our author Winston Churchill of the overall scene into which John Churchill would soon find himself increasingly involved.&nbsp; The one over-riding fact that affected the latter part of the 17</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> century in Europe, stressed Churchill, was the over-powering might, ambition&nbsp; and wealth of France.&nbsp; She had become much richer, better organised and of greater population than all other major nations in Europe just then.&nbsp; But this reality was complicated by the roles of the&nbsp; secondary powers as well.&nbsp; Who was an ally with whom and who the enemy ?&nbsp;&nbsp; How to gain and hold power, influence and wealth ?&nbsp; It was ever thus in Europe.&nbsp; Diplomacy and trust were&nbsp; crucial.</span></p>
<p class=rvps23><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his account of this situation, Churchill devotes 25 long paragraphs (all of his Chapter Four) in setting out this complicated background.&nbsp;&nbsp; (It is this historical aspect of which I felt I had very little appreciation and why I was attracted to reading&nbsp; the biography.)&nbsp;&nbsp; This is then followed in Chapter Five and beyond by an extensive account of John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s subsequent military and diplomatic career when he interacts with this complex military-political-religious-diplomatic reality, mainly on the Continent - between </span><span class=rvts4>1672</span><span class=rvts5> and&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1676,</span><span class=rvts5> initially, and then again many years later (post-</span><span class=rvts4>1700</span><span class=rvts5>) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to even greater effect and honour. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We begin by attempting to condense the background of this tumultuous and complex period to its key elements.&nbsp; It will necessarily be incomplete but should provide the general context of that important quarter century and so allow a better perspective of John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s initial involvements&nbsp; -&nbsp; ie&nbsp; in the </span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>hows and&nbsp; whys</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; of&nbsp; it all.&nbsp;&nbsp; We now have&nbsp; a copy also of an article on the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Franco-Dutch wars</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> of this period&nbsp; (time of Charles II); which slightly preceded those later conflicts </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; described by.our present Churchill&nbsp; as&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the wars of William and Anne</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; but, as concluded later, also to become known as&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>the 20 Year War</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> against France.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Churchill noted in his biography that the key reality of this period of English history was the over-powering position of France, he might have included a comment about the near equal position of Holland </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at least in the Naval and trading sphere.&nbsp; For the entire backdrop to our account of John Churchill would be played out essentially in terms of the conflicts between these two competing states (if soon involving England as well </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> supporting now one and now the other)&nbsp; and how that would serve to determine his own future military role). Without that on-going unresolved conflict, we may never have heard about a Duke of Marlborough. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two nations had previously recognised their mutual interests as early as the </span><span class=rvts4>1560</span><span class=rvts5>s when they formed an impressive Alliance that lasted a century </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to the </span><span class=rvts4>1660</span><span class=rvts5>s. While Louis XIV was irritated by Holland s Republicanism, Protestantism and their Trading rivalry, he realised that a continued military alliance with them was nevertheless in France</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s own best interests.&nbsp; But, eventually, in </span><span class=rvts4>1668</span><span class=rvts5>, the Dutch decided to join a triple alliance - </span><span class=rvts8>with</span><span class=rvts5> England and Sweden - to support Spain in their defence of the Spanish Netherlands&nbsp; (now Belgium) </span><span class=rvts8>against</span><span class=rvts5> France&nbsp; - which Louis had decided they should take over on their northern border&nbsp; (next to Holland).&nbsp; Before attempting to do so, however, they realised that they must now first subdue Holland.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this, he knew he would have to get England to change sides </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> knowing that they had already had two wars with Holland themselves (in </span><span class=rvts4>1652-54</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; under Cromwell and, more recently,&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1665-67</span><span class=rvts5>). </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> whom they too had seen&nbsp; as a great naval and trading rival.&nbsp; To get them to leave this new triple alliance, he would have to pay England an impressive 3 million pounds annually&nbsp; Amazingly, Sweden too agree to support the&nbsp; invasion of Holland by threatening&nbsp; Brandenburg-Prussia across the Baltic if they should intervene on the side of the Dutch.&nbsp; War was thus declared by </span><span class=rvts9>the French and English</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - against&nbsp; Holland - on 7 April </span><span class=rvts4>1672</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Morality in those days was simply </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>real politique</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the foregoing&nbsp; as the background and context, we may now examine John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s early career, starting from a minor role in that first action&nbsp; just off the Suffolk coast, at Sole Bay&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1672</span><span class=rvts5>. [We used to holiday near there in </span><span class=rvts11>19</span><span class=rvts4>72</span><span class=rvts5> !]&nbsp; In&nbsp; his account of John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s life and times, our modern day Churchill distinguishes two major phases in the former</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s military career:&nbsp; an earlier 4 year period from </span><span class=rvts4>1672</span><span class=rvts5> to</span><span class=rvts4> 1675</span><span class=rvts5> in which he rose swiftly from mere Ensign to Colonel (by 25) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> by his&nbsp; general conduct, personal qualities of confidence and the impression he made on all those of higher command in the fields in which he first served so successfully.&nbsp; The start of the second phase was very much delayed however - until almost </span><span class=rvts4>1700</span><span class=rvts5> (as also noted briefly above).&nbsp;&nbsp; He was finally then called upon to command the entire army of the Grande Alliance against France through 10 major campaigns on the Continent - which he accomplished with complete infallibility. [One thinks of the situation in </span><span class=rvts4>1939-40 </span><span class=rvts5>when someone else was called out of his </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>wilderness years</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; to suddenly </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>take over</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and Lead !]</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His progress between these two phases was much slower and difficult than that initial period may have promised, but he persisted against various setbacks to have his true colours finally fully recognised - once again.&nbsp; In that earlier period, he advanced from grade to grade&nbsp; rapidly by sheer ability, merit, and&nbsp; daring - that was apparently recognised and needed&nbsp; at the time.&nbsp; Later, there were many more political and diplomatic hurdles to negotiate with the growing numbers of other ambitious careers also seeking recognition and advancement.&nbsp;&nbsp; He would thus be 52 before he was finally in total command of the Grande Alliance army. But then </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>age</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> is just another name for </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>experience</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>. We begin with that first phase.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In early April </span><span class=rvts4>1672,</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; the&nbsp; almost dormant Treaty of Dover&nbsp; between France and England (described above) was suddenly and unexpectedly re-activated by Louis XIV&nbsp; when his armies, with English support, decided to invade their then mutual enemy Holland&nbsp; across the Rhine (whose Naval power against their mutual commercial interests was once again becoming&nbsp; more than irritating and, as explained, France needed to neutralise her before she could wrest Belgium Netherlands from Spain).&nbsp; But Holland retaliated cleverly by flooding their entire country, making it impossible to invade properly and take control.&nbsp; The Alliance&nbsp; withdrew in bewilderment. At first, it was assumed by writers of the day that young Churchill, with so many other officers, was a part of this combined force and limited action but it seems that he had in fact been ordered&nbsp; to take part in another, even earlier </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>surprise action</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; - on 13 March </span><span class=rvts4>1672</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; but at sea, against the Dutch fleet </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who were then at anchor off the Isle of Wight in southern England.&nbsp;&nbsp; This equally treacherous action (their latest war had still not been officially declared)&nbsp;&nbsp; also failed and the bulk of the Dutch fleet escaped.&nbsp; The regiment of soldiers conveyed to the scene did include John Churchill on this occasion, with&nbsp; his best friend George Legge; who both took part in the&nbsp; limited action (as though Marines rather than Army soldiers).&nbsp; John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; conduct and character were not specifically reported on.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the English Army had already joined forces with that of the French against the Dutch, so too had their two Navies </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the English contingent being commanded by&nbsp; James, Duke of York&nbsp; (John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s future patron).&nbsp;&nbsp; They and the French raced to the channel near the Thames estuary to cut off the Dutch escape from that Isle of Wight encounter (about late March that year) but were too late;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Dutch had already gained the wider North Sea and soon took up a defensive position off their own coast. The combined English-French fleet then took up a comparable position near the English coast off Suffolk&nbsp; with the intention of re-supplying&nbsp; themselves with needed men, provisions and munitions - to the extent that a depleted Treasury and awkward Parliament could afford or be willing to do so.&nbsp; The Dutch Admiral de Ruyter, appraised of the opposing fleets</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> preoccupied&nbsp; disposition wisely decide to attack </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> which he did to deadly effect&nbsp; on May 28, </span><span class=rvts4>1672</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; In about 8 hours, they had effectively destroyed their enemies</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> fleets.&nbsp; One ship, the Prince. had contained about 600 of the Guards regiment of which more than 200 were killed or wounded.&nbsp; De Ruyter finally withdrew at dusk and described the action as&nbsp; the&nbsp; hardest he had experienced of the&nbsp; thirty two in which&nbsp; he had been engaged.&nbsp; The offensive power of both his and the enemy fleets were significantly diminished for several weeks afterwards. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Churchill, one of those Guards on board, luckily survived although four Captains in that Admiralty regiment had not and John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s generally brave conduct (as reported to the Duke of York), coupled with&nbsp; those vacancies, served jointly to recommend him for a double promotion - from&nbsp; Ensign to a Marine Captaincy in that Admiralty regiment.&nbsp; It afforded him in addition a more personal protecting role with respect to his ultimate patron, the Duke of York, who headed that division.&nbsp; He had just turned 22.&nbsp; He returned to a welcoming Barbara Villiers </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> proud to assist him in the required purchase of his new uniform and kit.&nbsp; It would not be long before the continuing war between the new allies (France and England)&nbsp; and their&nbsp; Dutch&nbsp; enemy would flare up again </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in </span><span class=rvts4>1673/74</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As before, it was the French who had the power, the money and the men to force the issue </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with England</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s welcome support militarily and diplomatically.&nbsp; John Churchill was by this time a Captain in an English regiment of the French army and would soon become a&nbsp; Colonel.&nbsp; But the development of his career and his parts in the international conflicts at this time are described with&nbsp; little clarity by our author.(in Chapter Six).&nbsp; The situation in Europe during the </span><span class=rvts4>1670s</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; appeared to be one of almost continuous flux as to policy and resolve.&nbsp; A major problem in its analysis would seem to be the paucity of clear records in the archives or by means of retained correspondence of the principals involved.&nbsp; We shall attempt to place the many events described into some kind of chronology and thus into an assumed cause and effect sequence.&nbsp;&nbsp; There seems to have been much </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>playing one side against the other</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with its attendant hypocrisies&nbsp; as to what was really going on, who was in charge and what were their&nbsp; objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp; [The later acquired article on Wikipedia&nbsp; did clarify the chronology and composition of the opposing sides in&nbsp; this essentially Franco-Dutch war.] </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, by the end of </span><span class=rvts4>1672</span><span class=rvts5>, king Charles II was still relying on the shadowy Treaty of Dover with the French.&nbsp; This seems to have provided the English with French subsidies with which to maintain its weakened armed forces (at home and in France)&nbsp;&nbsp; including its defeated Navy after Sole Bay </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in exchange for continuing its Declaration of Indulgence - by which toleration of Catholics in England was still allowed.&nbsp; (Both Charles and especially his brother James were suspected of still being </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Papists</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> at heart.)&nbsp; Parliament had been prorogued for over a year and the interest owing on many governments loans from the moneylenders was not being re-paid.&nbsp; It was thus called back in Feb </span><span class=rvts4>1673</span><span class=rvts5> to try to sort matters out </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> which would require the raising of taxation to supply the government coffers with more liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing it did was demand the rescinding of that Declaration.&nbsp; For while Parliament was willing to continue the alliance against the Dutch (Louis</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s chief concern), </span><span class=rvts4>it was still the </span><span class=rvts13>pro-Catholic inclinations </span><span class=rvts4>of the Crown </span><span class=rvts5>that really concerned them</span><span class=rvts4>. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the Declaration was removed and a new Test act passed (by which all those of influence had to swear allegiance to the Protestant cause), they voted to provide a supply of funds of over a million pounds.&nbsp; But rumours were still rife that both Stuart brothers had retained their Catholic leanings. Indeed, James, Duke of York, finally renounced his various positions (being incompatible with loyalty to an ostensibly Protestant King) and was replaced by Prince Rupert.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the King himself remained under suspicion as the public became more aware of the real purpose of the Treaty of Dover&nbsp; Moreover, he had sanctioned a marriage between James&nbsp; and a Catholic princess </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Mary of Modena thereby ensuring a stronger Catholic position for the monarchy if and when James became&nbsp; heir to Charles.&nbsp; And such large contingents of the English army under French command made the people increasingly nervous;&nbsp; they worried that they could eventually be used to force the&nbsp; nation towards Catholicism. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the autumn of </span><span class=rvts4>1673</span><span class=rvts5>¸ Churchill was back at the front in Westphalia serving in the Admiralty Regiment </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> now with Prince Rupert </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but under the famous French commander Marshall Turenne for the rest of that year.&nbsp; There was apparently a story in which Turenne described the earlier loss of some minor position defended by an adequate number of troops which he predicted would soon be re-taken with just half that number&nbsp; by the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>handsome young English Captain</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> and this was indeed punctually accomplished.. While there were no great operations then planned, Churchill continued to impress and gain further promotion, despite the removal of the Duke of York, by early</span><span class=rvts4> 1674</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; It would seem that in their alliance it became necessary to prevail against certain of the German states (part of </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the Holy Roman Empire</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>) and their Imperial forces who, with Spain, had decided to ally with the Dutch to reduce Louis</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> growing power). as well as against&nbsp; the Dutch directly. [See article re why actions were so often centred then on German towns along the Rhine.]&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major campaign was launched on Holland by Louis in June </span><span class=rvts4>1674&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> by first besieging the large Dutch fortress at&nbsp; Maastricht.&nbsp; A delegation of English Officers, including Monmouth and John Churchill, were involved&nbsp; in the initial attack </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> on 27 June - and the fortress surrendered on the 30</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Louis publically praised the brave English.&nbsp; But various new alliances were making life more difficult for France and by Feb </span><span class=rvts4>1674</span><span class=rvts5>, the English Parliament decided to make peace with Holland and her various allies (as noted above).&nbsp; A suspicious Parliament ,had begun to see the Protestant Dutch as probably our more natural ally.&nbsp; The times they were </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>a changing</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> and they wanted peace with Holland. A new man, Sir Thomas Osborne (soon raised to&nbsp; Earl of Danby), was gaining power in Parliament and would become the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s effective Prime Minister in </span><span class=rvts4>1674.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; He was a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>John Bull</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> character </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> being fervently for the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>King and England</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; -&nbsp; but an Anglican England,&nbsp; not one for either Catholics or Dissenters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles bent with this prevailing wind (and times) and saw in Danby the strength of character to wield a strong, </span><span class=rvts8>supportive</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; Parliament&nbsp; under-pinning his monarchy.&nbsp; If they both played their cards right. they could&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>continue</span><span class=rvts5> to get money out of both Parliament and the French King - to England</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s long-term benefit. !&nbsp; All very Machiavellian !</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was awkward however to continue an alliance with France </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who would continue paying for English troops stationed there&nbsp; - and yet agree that they would no longer be&nbsp; available to fight Holland, still France</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s main enemy.&nbsp; A compromise was reached wherein several English regiments there would be reduced in size and amalgamated;&nbsp; they would&nbsp; continue providing help to France </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but against her other enemies - on her eastern (German) flank.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the French Marshall&nbsp; (Turenne) wanted those troops commanded </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>by that brilliant young English officer</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - John Churchill </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> soon to be made a Colonel for that&nbsp; purpose </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> which promotion immediately received&nbsp; Louis XIV</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s necessary blessing.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would all transpire in March/April&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts4> 1674</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; John still retained his Captain</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s rank in respect of his English regiment (still under the Duke of York) but this too was soon raised -&nbsp; to that of Lieutenant Colonel, the next year. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first action of this French-domiciled&nbsp; but English led regiment was the 1</span><span class=rvts16>st</span><span class=rvts5> battle of Sinzheim&nbsp; in Oct </span><span class=rvts4>1674</span><span class=rvts5> - against the&nbsp; Imperial army&nbsp; (ie of </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the Holy Roman Empire</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> an amorphous collection of mid-European states).&nbsp; Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s role on this earlier occasion was confirmed in two sources.&nbsp; Firstly, when writing about the later battle there (2</span><span class=rvts16>nd</span><span class=rvts5> battle of Sinzheim, - June </span><span class=rvts4>1704</span><span class=rvts5>)&nbsp; his Chaplain, a Mr Hare, later Bishop of Chichester, noted in his&nbsp; Journal of those times (when he often accompanied young Churchill) that&nbsp; the latter battle had brought back memories to him of that earlier occasion in </span><span class=rvts4>1674.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Churchill had received a letter dated even later (16 July </span><span class=rvts4>1711</span><span class=rvts5>) from a French widow Madame St Just from Metz.&nbsp; In it, she thanks Churchill profusely&nbsp; for ordering his troops not to ravage and destroy her estate at Mezeray (nr Sinzheim) during that earlier battle&nbsp; (as was being done generally in the area by Marshall Turenne</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s men&nbsp; - to prevent the enemy from re-grouping there).&nbsp; [Was John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s decision, Sir Winston&nbsp; wondered,&nbsp; based on memories about&nbsp; the destruction of an earlier widow</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s homestead </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at Ashe House&nbsp; - of </span><span class=rvts4>1644 </span><span class=rvts5>?]&nbsp;&nbsp; Such confirmations seemed important to our later Winston Churchill in that so many events in those earlier days do not have reliable provenance in the archive records.&nbsp; Where it does exist, he makes a point of quoting it </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to offset contrary rumours .often quoted by his more critical opposite numbers. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence of his presence also at a battle later that same year (late Sept/early Oct) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in Enzheim -&nbsp; is more certainly preserved in a letter written by John Churchill himself&nbsp; to the Duke of Monmouth (illegitimate son of Charles II by Lucy Walter)&nbsp; then in charge of the overall English contingent.&nbsp; John led his own English battalion (of 3 or 4 regiments), under Monmouth - as part of Turenne</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s 22,000 man Army - against double that number of Imperialist troops.&nbsp; Several other English battalions were involved in particular in a very bloody battle for something called </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the Little Wood</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (next to Waldheim)&nbsp; in which Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; battalion&nbsp; was again much praised by Turenne, although several other regiments were also recognised.&nbsp; The letter is quoted in full and reveals an objective professional post-battle assessment but with some suggestion that the heavy English losses there (especially of Officers) were suffered for little or no gain.&nbsp; But, he was learning the arts of war from the acknowledged master Turenne which he would apply successfully in several later battles in the future. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now, the English contribution to France was much reduced although the Franco-Dutch war itself would continue until </span><span class=rvts4>1678</span><span class=rvts5>, without the English.&nbsp; In the meantime, our author Winston provides us in his Chapter Seven with an interlude that covers </span><span class=rvts4>1675-76</span><span class=rvts5> - back at the English Court. It will nevertheless have significance&nbsp; in the on-going life and career of our hero.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; titled&nbsp; simply&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Sarah</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; as shall we (almost):</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, during the following 3 years </span><span class=rvts4>1775-77</span><span class=rvts5>, the wars on the continent involving France continued, still with some English support, but John Churchill did not play a part in them.&nbsp; Evidence as to why is scarce but it appears that rather than neither Louis or Turenne&nbsp; requiring his services, it was John himself who declined any overtures in that regard.&nbsp; It was later in </span><span class=rvts4>1675</span><span class=rvts5> that the younger sister of Frances Jennings </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> one </span><span class=rvts4>Sarah Jennings</span><span class=rvts5> - was also introduced to the Court.&nbsp; Frances herself had caused quite a stir two years earlier&nbsp;&nbsp; when she had become a Lady in Waiting to the Duchess of York&nbsp; She was a famous beauty who kept herself above the common herd and had no scandal as a mistress.&nbsp; Her sister Sarah, equally attractive </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>precocious, charming figure</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, was also noteworthy in that moral respect being very self-possessed and sharp of wit and temper.&nbsp; “Towards the end of </span><span class=rvts4>1675</span><span class=rvts5>, also now attached to the York</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s household, she began to attend balls and&nbsp; parties at Court with John Churchill “, notes Winston Churchill.&nbsp; After one such occasion,&nbsp; “…they fell in love with each other </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a love&nbsp; that was to last forever; neither of them henceforward loved anyone else in their entire lives”.&nbsp; She was just 15 and he 25.&nbsp; He professed his love for her in countless letters over the next two years </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> for ever seeking to see her virtually every day, if at all possible.&nbsp; She remained tantalisingly aloof however&nbsp; and was no pushover.&nbsp; But they </span><span class=rvts8>would</span><span class=rvts5> marry, eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jenning sisters were born to Rischard Jennings, Esq, a long serving MP for his home constituency of St Albans in Hertfordshire&nbsp; -&nbsp; of which county his father in turn had been High Sheriff&nbsp; as early as </span><span class=rvts4>1625</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The family owned property there and in Kent, as well as&nbsp; an earlier seat </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in Somersetshire&nbsp; - worth in total some $4000 a year.&nbsp; Richard had died before </span><span class=rvts4>1670</span><span class=rvts5> and his widow, an eccentric character of viiolent temper, thought of as almost a sorceress, had built up large debts and through the good offices of the Yorks, had acquired an apartment in the St James palace complex which apparently gave her legal protection from debt collectors.&nbsp; Amazingly. it was this same </span><span class=rvts9>family of Jennings</span><span class=rvts5> who had once owned the </span><span class=rvts4>Manor of Churchill in Somerset</span><span class=rvts5> for almost a hundred years (</span><span class=rvts4>1540s&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>to</span><span class=rvts4> 1640s</span><span class=rvts5>) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> eventually sold because of earlier debts and the Civil war </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts4>Sir John Churchill</span><span class=rvts5>, the successful pre- and post-Civil war&nbsp; London lawyer </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as described above.&nbsp; It sounds more like Dickens or Victor Hugo, but it</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s all true,&nbsp; not fiction.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earlier Sir Winston Churchill, our youmg John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father, later expressed the view that had the Jennings&nbsp; not been forced to sell&nbsp; that estate&nbsp; then, he understood that they would have eventually left it as an inheritance to the new husband to be of their younger daughter \Sarah </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who, unknown then, would in fact eventually become Sarah </span><span class=rvts9>Churchill</span><span class=rvts5> !&nbsp; This scenario is rather awkward to so interpret (re dates), but see further below.&nbsp; In any case, it seems a most odd coincidence in that we must assume that in meeting Sarah at Court in </span><span class=rvts4>1675</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; John Churchill would have had absolutely no idea of any such earlier connection with his family</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s distant past (or his own).&nbsp; Before they married, Sarah had two major disagreements with her troublesome mother and requested that she leave the palace </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> being as Sarah believed&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>mentally ill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; This was eventually carried out after which mother and daughter&nbsp; got on much better (as noted in later correspondence).&nbsp; Sarah continued living at St James herself while her sister would soon happily marry a Lord Hamilton. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November </span><span class=rvts4>1676</span><span class=rvts5>, there were overtures made to lure John back to the Continental wars (by Louis and his ministers) but when he declined, it was generally assumed that he was too taken up with courting slightly reluctant Sarah at that time.&nbsp; She was growing concerned at the delay in </span><span class=rvts8>his</span><span class=rvts5> proposal of marriage&nbsp; but as keen as he was, he knew that his lack of real wealth meant he couldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t afford to set up a proper home and life for her </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> just yet.&nbsp; Moreover, his father did not support his choice of a wife without proper wealth of her own.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had other ideas for him:&nbsp; There was in particular a girl at Court with a very wealthy father (not in good health) who would favour his only daughter to marry John Churchill.&nbsp; She was Catherine Sedley </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> not a great beauty but of recognised intelligence and general agreeableness.&nbsp; She had been a mistress of the Duke of York (along with Arabella&nbsp; and a Lady Ballssis)&nbsp; and was known as once saying in public that she “knew not what the Duke saw in any of us three; we were all rather plain, and it couldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t have been our wit, as he wouldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t have understood it !”. Our author, Sir Winston Churchill, imagines the attitude of his earlier namesake in seeking to convince his son John to marry Catherine rather than Sarah.&nbsp; He writes three long paragraphs </span><span class=rvts9>as he imagines John</span><span class=rvts10>’</span><span class=rvts9>s father would have more effectively put the case to his son.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; They are very compelling arguments.&nbsp; John is clearly between a rock and a hard place.&nbsp; Sarah hears about Catherine .and is becoming increasingly annoyed and&nbsp; cool.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of </span><span class=rvts4>1676</span><span class=rvts5>, John had broken completely with Barbara Villiers, much to her chagrin; she went off in a huff </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to live in Paris.&nbsp; But the tensions between him and Sarah were not of that ilk but rather because his repeated expressions of undying love for her were never backed up by any reference to exactly </span><span class=rvts8>when they might reasonably marry</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Until then, she remained somewhat aloof and unresponsive </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> much to his dismay.&nbsp;&nbsp; John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father remained a problem; he would not give his agreement to their marriage </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> not that this would have any legal standing (although his future inheritance could well be compromised).&nbsp; By early </span><span class=rvts4>1677</span><span class=rvts5>, however, John appears to have got the message from Sarah and began seeking ways to ensure a more secure financial future - including greater understanding from his patrons </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the Yorks </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> after which his father came on side as well.&nbsp; In any case, they were finally married in about December </span><span class=rvts4>1677</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> probably in the apartments of one of the Royal family at St James </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but no trace has been found of a Church or chapel marriage registration&nbsp; or the date of same.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; that they celebrated the marriage and spent their honeymoon at her former home in Royston, Herts.&nbsp; But, now, where could they afford to&nbsp; live ? </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts8>[It is interesting to note about here that John</span><span class=rvts14>’</span><span class=rvts8>s uncle Jasper Churchill (3) was then living not 500 yards away - in The Strand -&nbsp; where he was himself apparently </span><span class=rvts14>‘</span><span class=rvts8>rolling in money</span><span class=rvts14>’</span><span class=rvts8> - at least as owed him from the many monetary advances he had made to the gentry and aristocracy during the </span><span class=rvts13>1670</span><span class=rvts8>s. He died in </span><span class=rvts13>1678</span><span class=rvts8> and presumably his wife Frances became rather well off. Meanwhile John and Sarah were still counting their pennies !]</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s situation had&nbsp; improved, he was himself still not that well off and his father</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s estate was of less value than formerly.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he and his wife were happy to provide accommodation for the newly-weds at their new Dorset home at Minterne Magna when they were not still living in John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s bachelor apartments on Jermyn Street, just of St James in London.&nbsp; Otherwise they were often away on his duties living in temporary married quarters with the Duke of York and/or the Regiment.&nbsp; It would be 5 years before he could afford to provide his wife and family with their own home (</span><span class=rvts4>1682</span><span class=rvts5>).&nbsp; [So much for the rumours that Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland,&nbsp; had given him untold funds.]&nbsp;&nbsp; During his 3 years away from military action (</span><span class=rvts4>1775-78</span><span class=rvts5>), John did at least gain in diplomatic experience at which his exceptional skills were becoming recognised and to match those on the field.&nbsp; Once married, he continued in this sphere as needed </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> always with&nbsp; \Sarah</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; complete support. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the political arena, Danby had reached the peak of his influence in </span><span class=rvts4>1678</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Importantly, he had arranged the marriage between Holland</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s William of Orange and Mary, the elder daughter&nbsp; of the Duke of York, just the year before. This Protestant union was yet one more nail in the coffin of any continued alliance with Catholic France.&nbsp; The gradual alliance with Holland of Prussia, Spain and the (Holy Roman) Empire, soon extended to include England as well, finally placed France in a vulnerable position.&nbsp; For a time, Charles sought further subsidies from them to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>stay on side</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, but the writing was effectively on the wall.&nbsp; Parliament was finally ready to sever the French connection completely and had they done so in a more timely fashion, progress would likely have been quicker and more&nbsp; efficient. As it was, the times favoured John Churchill in both his diplomatic and military options, in any case.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The English army was increased to 30,000 men and on Feb 18 </span><span class=rvts4>1678</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; John was promoted to the rank of Colonel in a new regiment of Foot.&nbsp; He and Sarah were&nbsp; still&nbsp; residing in Minterne at the time when John was summoned by the Duke to London.&nbsp; {It is interesting to recall that at that same time, the&nbsp; Churchills of Dorchester were enjoying the quiet life of Dorset country Squires&nbsp; at Muston.]&nbsp;&nbsp; John wrote back to Sarah shortly after saying that the Duke wanted him to go to Holland to lead negotiations in regard to the balance of forces from Holland, Spain and England against France,&nbsp; if required.&nbsp; Decisions had to be made in respect of&nbsp; 4 English battalions still stationed in Bruges as well.&nbsp; John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s friend Sidney Godolphin had been sent to deal with political matters arising. John was to promise 20,000 troops with guns to William.&nbsp; Trust was thus being given to two young men of recognised merit of the next generation and important new relationships were being forged with&nbsp; William of Orange and with England</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s future political direction.&nbsp; Although the Duke and his half brother Monmouth were still of a pro-Catholic disposition, they finally switched sides (as Charles had wanted for some time) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to support Protestant Holland by the end of April </span><span class=rvts4>1678</span><span class=rvts5> - fearing France</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s continued attempt at Catholic domination in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 1</span><span class=rvts16>st</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>1678</span><span class=rvts5>, John Churchill was appointed a Brigadier of Foot, with powers to recruit men to fill the several Infantry Regiments of two&nbsp; new&nbsp; Battalions&nbsp; - thus constituting a full Brigade.&nbsp;&nbsp; By June, he was ready to proceed to Flanders - to oppose the French there and his orders arrived to that effect on Sept&nbsp; 5</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> that year;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was to accompany another new Brigadier,&nbsp; Sir John Fenwick,&nbsp; with his equivalent forces. After Monmouth had also joined William of Orange</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s attack of a week earlier, with another 8000 English troops, Charles II sought to determine if Louis was ready yet&nbsp; to sue for Peace.&nbsp; A kind of stalemate ensued and during the next three years (late </span><span class=rvts4>1679 </span><span class=rvts5>to</span><span class=rvts4> 1682</span><span class=rvts5>), John and Sarah had to lead a precarious, non-military existence as diplomatic go-betweens their patrons (the Duke and Duchess of York)&nbsp; and the two significant monarchs of the age&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; Charles&nbsp; II and Louis XIV,&nbsp; and their Ministers.&nbsp; The British public and their Parliament would no longer accept the Duke</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s increasing Catholicism (especially as he would normally become their next monarch) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> so he was first exiled to Belgium and later to Scotland.&nbsp; John Churchill and wife were themselves 100% Anglicans but the Duke would trust no one else as much to try to negotiate his situation with all and sundry over those difficult years.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our modern day Churchill then quotes about a dozen letters between John and Sarah which reflect these awkward times for them.&nbsp; On about 24&nbsp; Oct </span><span class=rvts4>1679</span><span class=rvts5>, Sarah gave birth to their first child </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a daughter - Harriet Churchill.&nbsp; At that time, John was on his way to Scotland by coach to attend the Duke. Because of the ill feelings towards the latter, John expresses the need to keep moving on as he does not find it safe wherever he stays overnight (as at Doncaster or Berwick, say).&nbsp; He is in Edinburgh by mid-December and writes that if he is required to remain there, he prays that Sarah will come to join him immediately.&nbsp; However, by the end of January, King Charles had sent word that James and family could finally return from exile to London. Churchill accompanied them, leaving at the end of&nbsp; February by sea-going yacht.&nbsp; He was not very well then, suffering from the severe headaches and seizures&nbsp; that he had had periodically since childhood.&nbsp; Nor was his young daughter Harriet well back home&nbsp; - whom&nbsp; he hoped would soon&nbsp; be over her </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>red spots</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; He arrived&nbsp; home (in Jermyn Street) by early&nbsp; March&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>1680</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; just in time to see her before she sadly died in her&nbsp; infancy </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; just 4 months old.&nbsp; No anti-biotics then. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During </span><span class=rvts4>1680</span><span class=rvts5> and </span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4>81</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; John Churchill continued to serve the Duke of York as best he could despite the latter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; continued obstinacy in adhering to the Catholic faith (secretly) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> whether back in Scotland or in London.&nbsp; In either case, the combined religious and political forces in the country kept the Duke increasingly suspect and liable to exile.&nbsp; Finally, at the end of </span><span class=rvts4>1682</span><span class=rvts5>, Churchill was rewarded by the King with something called </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>the Barony of Churchill in Aymouth - a title within the Peerage of Scotland.&nbsp; Whether this entailed any financial benefit or not is not mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, the careers of two&nbsp; future queens </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> sisters Mary and Anne </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> enter&nbsp; the scene from about this period on.. They had,&nbsp; of course, always been around </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as young girls at Court </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the latter quite reliant on her best friend, a slightly older Sarah Jennings </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> later Churchill.&nbsp; And, as noted, her elder sister Mary would eventually marry William of Orange and so further ensure a Protestant&nbsp; continuity and influence for the&nbsp; future Crown. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But their stories must take a back seat through the early years of this period </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ca </span><span class=rvts4>1680 -83</span><span class=rvts5> - when Lord Shaftesbury and a Whig Parliament replaced Danby and the Tories.&nbsp; Anyone now suspected of promoting the Catholic cause was liable to be imprisoned and executed </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> often on slim evidence.&nbsp; This included even Charles</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> queen </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Catherine - and still his brother James, even more than before.&nbsp; Shjaftesbury seemed to be a kind of Vicar of Bray character, having previously supported the Treaty of Dover with France, the Declaration of Indulgence and those millions (of francs)&nbsp; from France - when it suited him.&nbsp; Bu, increasingly,&nbsp; no&nbsp; longer.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the background of this new political conflict </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> between two opposing factions which would soon coalesce into the Liberal and Conservative parties in Britain for the next 300 years </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> King Charles II managed to take a relatively neutral stance but did act decisively on one important occasion and come out surprisingly unscathed.&nbsp; The conflicts were fought out at all levels of society </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in law Courts, in State trials, in assassination Plots and in Parliament </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> everywhere except on the battlefield, although that too was a close run thing. .&nbsp; It was a </span><span class=rvts8>kind of</span><span class=rvts5> civil war, says Churchill, whose outcome would effectively determine the left-right political system not only of Britain but&nbsp; of countless other nations in the future. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Churchill describes the events of this 3 year period vividly in 4 long paragraphs that would be very difficult to summarise except in 4 even longer paragraphs.&nbsp; Suffice to say that after the former Cromwellians had voiced their growing anger at the dissolute life style of the rich generally and the Court of the monarch in particular </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with an increasing belief that such as the&nbsp; Great Fire and the Plague were God</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s punishments for their wickedness&nbsp; and, after three Elections with&nbsp; everyone at each other throats, the King suddenly decided to dissolve Parliament in </span><span class=rvts4>1680</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; He re-convened them in </span><span class=rvts4>1681</span><span class=rvts5> - but at Oxford </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to avoid the typically riotous crowds of London.&nbsp; But that new Whig Parliament set to with even more determination - to exclude Catholic-tainted James from succeeding Charles.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaftesbury then presented an ultimatum to Charles requiring him to name his illegitimate (and now Protestant) son Monmouth to succeed&nbsp; rather than his Catholic-leaning brother James.&nbsp; Charles refused and dissolved Parliament again and retired to Windsor castle for his own protection. Some politicians wanted a Republic, and a Plot was hatched to assassinate both royal brothers; others had already been executed </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> often unfairly.&nbsp; But, amazingly, by </span><span class=rvts4>1682</span><span class=rvts5>, the mood of the general public began to turn </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; as though the anti-Catholic feeling had finally burnt itself out </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at least, for now.&nbsp; Too much innocent blood had been shed already.&nbsp; The King decided to prosecute Shaftesbury for high treason </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but only after&nbsp; replacing many of the latter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Whig place men in the Courts and Sheriffs</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> offices in rabid London.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaftesbury fled to protestant Holland but soon died there in exile.&nbsp; Other chief Whigs and plotters were turned against and revengeful executions ensued.&nbsp; The times were indeed very difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By </span><span class=rvts4>1683</span><span class=rvts5>, the King was thus once again safe on his English throne and, moreover, had ensured the hereditary principle of primogeniture </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with the Crown still due to accede to his brother James.&nbsp; Charles&nbsp; was effectively still in the pay of the French King but the latter no longer had any local political or military influence in England&nbsp;&nbsp; The next three years (</span><span class=rvts4>1683-85</span><span class=rvts5>) were thus ones of relative&nbsp; peace and so John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s role vis a vis his patron James, Duke of York could proceed again on a less troubled basis.&nbsp; His life at Court could resume and, in fact, he became a frequent companion of the monarch himself </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> often playing tennis with him and with other fellow courtiers.&nbsp; He was promoted to the post of Colonel of the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Own Dragoons with an increase in salary.&nbsp; As a result, he and Sarah were finally able to purchase their own house in the country </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> on the edge of&nbsp; St Albans -&nbsp; not far from where Sarah grew up. [Shirley and I often shopped in its weekly street market there when we lived in nearby Hertford town in about </span><span class=rvts4>1965/66 </span><span class=rvts7>–</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts5>almost 300 years later.]</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jennings sisters Frances and Sarah had inherited a small Manor&nbsp; called Sandridge&nbsp; situated on one side of St Albans </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as well as an old house and a few acres - called Holywell House - on the other side of town, near the bridge over the small river Ver.&nbsp; John bought out Frances</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> share of the latter&nbsp; in </span><span class=rvts4>1681</span><span class=rvts5> and by </span><span class=rvts4>1684</span><span class=rvts5>, he and Sarah had the old house pulled down and a new one built nearby&nbsp; on its land.&nbsp; With Sarah, John Churchill would live there for the rest their lives.&nbsp; In many letters home, he expressed&nbsp; his longing to, return there with affection. He never resided at the famous Blenheim Palace to be built for him later by a grateful nation. His St Albans house was itself eventually pulled down in </span><span class=rvts4>1827</span><span class=rvts5> and sadly no trace of it remains today. Their eldest daughter Harriet died quite young there&nbsp; but they bad two more girls </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Henrietta in </span><span class=rvts4>1681</span><span class=rvts5> and Anne in </span><span class=rvts4>1684</span><span class=rvts5> who both thrived and were raised at St Albans. There were no sons as yet and the future of this impressive line of Churchills&nbsp; seemed&nbsp; unlikely and may have to proceed via issue of his eventually married daughters - when teir issue</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s surnames would gradually be altered to reflect the more famous one. Our author Winston Spencer-Churchill would descend from a cousin line from this source.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While John and Sarah were content to live their future lives at Holywell House in the country (rather than near Whitehall or the Palace in London, with its&nbsp; increasingly fraught Court of intrigue and complexity).&nbsp; John was content to ride into London only when his positions required&nbsp; it, but&nbsp; a&nbsp; role there for Sarah&nbsp; seemed more difficult to avoid.&nbsp; Her childhood friend the Princess Anne, now into adulthood, had a continual need of her.&nbsp; And, as our author Sir Winston remarks “Anne (and her times) will soon become the central fulcrum of our tale”.&nbsp; To Anne, Sarah represented all that she wanted in an affectionate close friend and insisted there be no difference in rank expressed between them </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> especially on a private, personal level. And John too would gradually assume a more protective role in regard to Anne himself than would normally be the case </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as the reigns first of Charles II and then of his brother James II came to their respective closes.&nbsp; He and Sarah, with their close friend Godolphin and the two royal sisters Mary and Anne thus formed a tight bond and, with others of like mind. frequently met together secretly in&nbsp; private rooms in the Palace </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> ones they jointly agreed to call&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts8>the Cockpit</span><span class=rvts14>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; With the succession and the religious, military and political situations all growing more complex, important decisions made there would prove decisive in both John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s,&nbsp; and in the nation</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s,&nbsp; successful future.</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4>CHAPTER 24</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4>THE FINAL YEARS</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts4><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles II died early on&nbsp; Jan 27 </span><span class=rvts4>1685</span><span class=rvts5> from an unexpected stroke suffered during the&nbsp; night.&nbsp; His brother James, the Duke, had long anticipated and prepared for this event and his own accession to the Crown.&nbsp; He had been cultivating a much less obvious expression&nbsp; of&nbsp; his under-lying Catholicism over the preceding 2 years.&nbsp; He met with the necessary Privy Council within 15 minutes of Charles middle of the night passing (!) and proclaimed to them his total willingness to rule the country </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts3>according to its democratic laws and established religion</span><span class=rvts18>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; He would keep his own faith privately to himself and family, </span><span class=rvts9>he promised</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The public appeared quite ready for this succession </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in this traditional way - especially as the Tories were now in power and were essentially a pro-Anglican, anti-Dissident (Puritan) party, that were relatively tolerant of the few Catholics </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>old religion</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This contrasted with the Whigs who were much more anti-Catholic but pro-Dissident (as Methodism) , and not so pro-Anglican (of the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>establishment</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; Their hope for the future monarchy had laid in the direction of the (protestant) Duke of Monmouth </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> Charles</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> eldest but illegitimate son then in exile in Protestant Holland (along with Scotland</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s like-minded Lord Argyll).&nbsp; But, they were not then in power - but ever hopeful to return to same and thet</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>d even contemplated attempting a coup - believing that back home, there were many of their persuasion. And Holland</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; monarch William would happily lead them if this came to pass.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An election was soon called and the new Parliament were still solidly Tory and quite happy with the new King James and his public Proclamation (tkat ptomise) .&nbsp; This was still in early </span><span class=rvts4>1685</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; But, notes our author, “Events were at hand which would impel&nbsp; James to cast aside&nbsp; his intended and proclaimed restraints.”&nbsp; These pro-Catholic </span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>events</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> (clarified later) weren</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t quite </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>at hand</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> just yet, however, for an earlier event of some consequence would&nbsp; first&nbsp; intervene - and bring John Churchill firmly back into our story. For Monmouth did quite quickly decide to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>invade</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, along with Argyll.&nbsp; They each raised small armies and, with three ships each, made their respective ways back to England and Scotland (from Holland).&nbsp; In very windy conditions, Monmouth</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s&nbsp; ships were tossed hither and thither in the English channel for over two weeks and, quite coincidentally, finally made port </span><span class=rvts8>at Lyme Regis</span><span class=rvts5> in Dorset&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> apparently arbitrarily </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> on June 11</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>1685</span><span class=rvts5>. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, the local MP there then was of course none other than John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father - Sir Winston Churchill !&nbsp; He had recently shifted his constituency from Weymouth to there and of course immediately that he received news of this </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>rebellious imvasion</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - centred on his constituency -&nbsp; sent messages to his son John, to the government and to the Palace </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> by June 13</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; This would give John further scope to display his loyalty (for now) to the new King and likely to increase the merit of his reputation as a successful leader </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> now of Btigade strength&nbsp; or larger&nbsp;&nbsp; Any battles, in June and July </span><span class=rvts4>1685</span><span class=rvts5>), would thus take place in country he knew from his youth </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in Somerset, Devon&nbsp; and Dorset.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monmouth would rely on gathering support as he moved inland </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> from&nbsp; natural Whig supporters and various Dissident Protestant groups with considerable&nbsp; anti-Tory, anti-Catholic, anti-Establishment sympathies of that rural west-country population (mostly farm labourers and small traders).&nbsp; But he had little time to train them.&nbsp; He proclaimed to the public that James had in fact murdered his own father Charles, and that he (Monmouth) was himself actually born </span><span class=rvts8>in wedlock</span><span class=rvts5>, etc, etc.&nbsp; One could sum up the ensuing conflict as it quickly ran its course within the rather limited scope of these adjoining English counties, without its considerable detail, but it might be&nbsp; useful firstly to at least quote more fully some of our author</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s rich prose regarding the circumstances leading up to this affair </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> generally referred to as </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Monmouth</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Rebellion</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; He describes it all with a certain relish !</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He takes up his description from the point when John Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s father (and his own namesake, Sir Winston Churchill) learns (in London) of the surprise arrival of Monmouth in Lyme Regis, his very constituency. “He took the messengers just arrived from that west country town directly to the Palace himself and, summoning his son John, they were immediately conducted to the King.&nbsp; This must have been a great day for old Sir Winston, one in which all the harmonies of his life seemed happily finally to merge.&nbsp; Here was the (new) King for whose sacred rights and royal line he had himself fought with sword and pen (in the </span><span class=rvts4>1640</span><span class=rvts5>s), for whom he had suffered so much, and&nbsp; had also done him the honour </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> no mere formality </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of making him (when still the Duke)&nbsp; four times a grandfather (via Arabella), now once more assaulted by rebellion. The same obstinate, traitorous forces </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> happily without votes </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> were again rampant in those same familiar west-country scenes in which he had lived his early life.&nbsp; The old cause was once more at stake, and in the old place. And here now stood his own son, now Colonel of the Dragoons, the rising soldier of the day, high in the favour of the threatened monarch, long linked to his very service, who would march forward at the head of the Household Troops </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>corps d</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>elite, - </span><span class=rvts8>to lay the insolent usurper low</span><span class=rvts5> !&nbsp; It was Sir Winston</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s apotheosis.&nbsp; There must have been a strong feeling of the continuity of history in this small group, which </span><span class=rvts8>this prophetic coincidence</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; had so brought together !”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That very night John Churchill, raised to the rank of Brigadier-General,&nbsp;&nbsp; set out with his Troops and with a Colonel and his Regiment.&nbsp; Monmouth could not have made&nbsp; his move at a worse moment (for his own designs).&nbsp; The Tory Parliament was still in session.&nbsp; An act of Attainder against Monmouth was immediately passed and a price of £ 5000.&nbsp; placed on his head (about £400,000 today) .&nbsp; The King was at his most popular and both Houses voted all necessary supplies (of money) and assured the King they were ready to die in his defence.&nbsp; Other troops still in Holland were sent home </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with William of Orange</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s approval at this stage (which he saw however as too soon for success);&nbsp; he</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>d bide his own time).&nbsp; He had indeed tried to dissuade Monmouth from making his attempt just yet (and no doubt hoped to get the call from England </span><span class=rvts8>himself</span><span class=rvts5> (a fellow Protestant) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but rather later </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to proceed against James and Catholicism (including in Ireland).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Churchill reached Bridport in Dorset on June 17</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; and found the situation worse than feared. While the nobility and gentry were still </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>for the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, the people generally (Dissident country-folk and tradesmen) were for Monmouth and Non-Anglican Protestantism.&nbsp; Even the county militias, if poorly trained, and initially for the King soon deserted that cause and joined the rebels.&nbsp; Churchill wrote to the King from Bridport pointing all this out and indicated that he would need some of the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s other regular forces </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to better encourage those he did have.&nbsp; Monmouth had entered Taunton in Somerset on the 18</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> (finding some loyalty there) and Churchill and his men soon moved inland in that direction.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way, he received messages from Monmouth (at Chard) asking him to remember their old friendship and begging his aid now.&nbsp; John, carefully weighing his own </span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>long term</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> position, wisely sent the message back to the King saying </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>he of course declined the invitation</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, in the meantime, the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s council had time to weigh up the situation themselves and while content with Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s known military abilities, had some slight reservations in placing him in overall command because of his background in the local area of concern (the west country)&nbsp; -&nbsp; known for&nbsp; its Protestant and Dissenting sympathies.&nbsp; The former Duke of York knew too of his underlying anti-Catholic and pro-Protestant views </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if still a fervent Royalist who (at this stage) over-looked James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> underlying if dormant Catholicism). . So he placed a renown French-descended leader - M. Feversham&nbsp; - in command, as a precaution. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While accepting this, despite expressing his view that he (John) was more than capable in dealing with Monmouth forthwith, he decided it was politic to obey Feversham to the letter, but no doubt grew further suspicious of James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> longer term motivations. Meanwhile, Monmouth was having difficulty in gaining the overwhelming support he had vainly hoped for (as at Bristol which Feversham had reached a day earlier) and, after&nbsp; a small skirmish near Bath with the&nbsp; latter, had eventually to face the English troops just north of Taunton led by&nbsp; both Churchill and a late-arriving Feversham. The key battle took place on July 5</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts4>1685</span><span class=rvts5> - on the fields of Sedgemoor, near the village of Weston Zayland in Somerset.&nbsp; A night attack was planned and executed by Monmouth but, by dawn, the growing light soon revealed his hopeless position.&nbsp; He attempted to escape but was later found in a ditch, cold and hungry, and soon taken prisoner - to London.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Feversham partied in Taunton revelling in sight of his captured enemy, Churchill quietly slipped home to Sarah and was later&nbsp; lauded&nbsp; by his own men who spoke disparagingly of Feversham at Court who, nevertheless was subsequently honoured by James as the seeming hero (which outcome and attendant praise Churchill had fully predicted).&nbsp; But rather than make any obvious moves to seek any recognition himself (as based on those general comments by all the other Officers at Court) Churchill wisely kept his&nbsp; cards close to his chest and wouldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t reveal his true growing feelings regarding James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> expected treachery (to renege on his Proclamation).&nbsp;&nbsp; He said all the right things, for now, and bided his time.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after the defeat of Monmouth in mid-</span><span class=rvts4>1685</span><span class=rvts5>, James grew increasingly confident in his position.&nbsp; Both Parliament and the Army, as well as the public generally, were expressing their increasing loyalty to him; he was&nbsp; displaying a&nbsp; growing sense of his royal power (long anticipated) and, as a consequence, began following&nbsp; a path more in tune with his heart than his head.&nbsp; (The </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>events</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> referred to by Churchill.)&nbsp; His tacit purpose thus became one of veering England, ever so&nbsp; gradually, towards a Catholic future and himself as&nbsp; an absolute&nbsp; monarch </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> a la Louis XVI.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; he realised that his accession promises would have to be diluted </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if again only gradually.&nbsp; He would slowly place his true Catholic confidantes into positions of power or influence&nbsp; - whether as Ministers, members of&nbsp; Parliament,&nbsp; Judges in the Courts, or Officers in the Army.&nbsp; The Whig</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s Test Act and Habeas Corpus would have to be over-turned.&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts14>‘</span><span class=rvts8>His</span><span class=rvts14>’</span><span class=rvts8> </span><span class=rvts5>Army would be greatly increased and those (often Irish) Catholics recruited to help in the recent attempted rebellion would now be retained </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but&nbsp; as Officers.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He began increasingly to display the same obstinacy in not abandoning a belief in the divine right of Kings </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> effectively to rule dictatorially, as shown by his naively rigid grandfather Charles 1</span><span class=rvts16> - </span><span class=rvts5>50 years earlier.&nbsp; While the country and Parliament in its Protestant Tory orientation were fairly tolerant of these initial pro-Catholic adjustments during </span><span class=rvts4>1685-86</span><span class=rvts5>, this direction of change (even seeking to bring the Dissenters into a coalition with the Catholics against the established Anglican church and the Tory establishment) was ultimately opposed by the Protestant majority. It has been estimated that less than one family in 400 were true Catholics at that time;&nbsp; that is, but&nbsp; a quarter of 1% !&nbsp; And even some of them were concerned that the King was obviously trying to alter the prevailing faith of the country </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> so going against his own Proclamation to the contrary.&nbsp; Not a wise move. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the autumn of </span><span class=rvts4>1687</span><span class=rvts5>, things were getting out of hand and by April </span><span class=rvts4>1688</span><span class=rvts5>, they had become&nbsp; progressively worse .and several senior politicians, headed by Danby, decided to act outside Parliament and secretly invite William of Orange to be ready to invade. He had married James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> elder daughter Mary (conveniently brought up a Protestant) and together they could rightfully claim and share the Crown of Britain - if James did not keep to his proclaimed promises of </span><span class=rvts4>1685</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two chief Ministers of the cabinet (Sunderland and Jeffery) finally sought to convince James, in about June </span><span class=rvts4>1688</span><span class=rvts5>, to rescind all ,his pro-Catholic orders or that invitation (of which he would likely now be aware would be proceeded with and implemented forthwith).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Churchill had remained loyal to the King almost to the last but had frequently to remind James that this was with </span><span class=rvts8>the unyielding proviso</span><span class=rvts5> that his own Protestant faith and belief in democracy for his country would in any final analysis </span><span class=rvts11>always</span><span class=rvts5> take precedence.&nbsp; And so it did.&nbsp; That precedence was finally expressed secretly in writing to William by Aug </span><span class=rvts4>1688</span><span class=rvts5> - although he continued to express loyalty (to the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s person) for the next three months to the extent that James might yet be persuaded to relent in his almost suicidal determination to turn the nation Catholic.&nbsp; Thus, on Aug 4 </span><span class=rvts4>1688</span><span class=rvts5>, John wrote a letter to William in Holland committing his service entirely to him to insure the continuation of their shared Protestant faith in a democratic United Kingdom.&nbsp; By October that year, William was indeed readying his army and navy to come to the aid of the Kingdom to this end as, by then, that Protestant status&nbsp; strongly appeared still to be purposely opposed by James; a critical point had, in many minds, indeed been finally reached.&nbsp; Several Ministers and ex-Ministers then sought William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s intervention more explicitly forthwith. Sunderland, who had played both sides against the middle seemingly, turned out to be in most minds already plotting against James (secretly) for some months past while only appearing to be loyal.&nbsp; He was not alone.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s ships and troops then sailed on Oct 19th and, after powerful north-easterly winds forced him further west than wanted, he finally landed at Torbay, Devon&nbsp; on&nbsp; November&nbsp; 5</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> that year. On learning this, James then mis-calculated in thinking that William would not attract many supporters in that Whig</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>ish, Dissenting </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>far west-country</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>. He was wrong.&nbsp; William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s ship had flown the English flag embroidered with his motto: “I will maintain the Protestant religion and the Liberties of England”. This simple message basically </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>said it all</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; After landing, he organised his men (from many Protestant nations) in Exeter before starting out for London.&nbsp; James had arranged for his own large army (of uncertain loyalty) to proceed to Salisbury about where, if William advanced from Exeter, they would likely meet.&nbsp; At the very last moment, James had apparently relented on many of the demands made earlier by Sunderland </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> except for re-calling Parliament, saying he couldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t do so with an invading power in the land.&nbsp; But this rather weak response was in any case now too late.&nbsp; William was on his way and the nation had had enough of James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> continual vacillations.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once landed and marching towards the heart of England, William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s army received word of James having ordered his army, now led by his trusted Feversham, to the Salisbury area in mid-south England.&nbsp; On 7 November, to ensure as much as possible the loyalty of his mainly English army, especially its Officers, James promoted John Churchill (still holding his cards very close to his chest) to the rank of&nbsp; Brigadier heading a full division </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> but still under Feversham.&nbsp; By this point, Churchill was definitely not looking for any leadership role, even overall command, if it implied he was to pursue the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s underlying goal of a Catholic England. Nevertheless, he still played along as though he would be opposing the advancing William (as an invader) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> in the unlikely event that James did relent in his Catholic, authoritarian fixation (at the last minute).&nbsp; Possibly John hadn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>yet heard the aphorism pertaining to the Jesuits:&nbsp; “Give me the boy to 7, and I will show you the man”.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise,&nbsp; he was apparently about to reveal his desertion (based on his consistently expressed views) as he and the King marched together - from Windsor towards Salisbury </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> where he would leave him a letter explaining his </span><span class=rvts9>finally revealed decision</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to be delivered just after he and his men had in the night suddenly taken a more decisive southwest route.&nbsp; This was so triggered after he had&nbsp; received news&nbsp; privately that an Officer in the Dragoon Guards&nbsp; (Lord Conbury, eldest son of Lord Clarendon) had arrived at the Salisbury field a few hours before&nbsp; Churchill or the&nbsp; King&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the army were already there and, being the most senior Officer there,&nbsp; he was thus in sole command for about critical 4 hours.&nbsp; He quickly announced to&nbsp; the&nbsp; junior Officers that </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>he had Orders for an immediate raid on one of William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s advanced attachments</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts8>This was a total deception</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; He thus took 3 Regiments of Horse and marched them directly towards Axminster and thence to Honiton, Devon&nbsp; (ie westward) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> not </span><span class=rvts8>to confront</span><span class=rvts5> William but to </span><span class=rvts15>meet up with</span><span class=rvts5> his army </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> to </span><span class=rvts8>join</span><span class=rvts5> them (and Churchill) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> and thus to now </span><span class=rvts8>oppose</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; James. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cornbury</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s desertion (seemingly part of the plot hatched earlier with, amongst other, Churchill) was thus the first of many desertions to follow (although the mood overall was still on a knife-edge as to who would and who wouldn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t desert).&nbsp; Many young Officers in James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> army simply wanted to be on the winning side, whoever it was, for their own later advancement.&nbsp; Churchill had hoped that if the tide of support appeared to be edging away from James (who still had the larger army), most of the men would come over to William, now with Churchill clearly on board as well.&nbsp; It was a very risky strategy </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> still of uncertain outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foregoing was decided upon as a way to avoid an all-out conflict and deaths that could instead be settled by negotiation </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> if most of the men could see the likelihood of William gaining so much support that James was bound to lose.&nbsp; Various elements of the audacious desertion of Lord Cornbury and his men (from supporting James) , including the fact that, critically, he had somehow been left in sole command before James and Churchill and other senior Officers had arrived at Salisbury, that he and others including Churchill had often met in October (at the Cockpit) to discuss matters of the succession (Cornbury being a cousin of Princess Anne - William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s sister in law) all pointed to this pre-arranged Plot -&nbsp; to encourage James to negotiate a peace rather than engage with his now apparently growing enemy </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with so many likely casualties.&nbsp; Indeed, Anne had written a letter to William some uncertain time before November 18 (when it was so dated and sent from the Cockpit) assuring him that&nbsp; “...he had all her good wishes for success and that her husband Prince George (of Denmark) </span><span class=rvts8>would</span><span class=rvts5> be joining him </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> despite having ridden with the King just the day before (17</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5>) from Windsor&nbsp; towards Salisbury&nbsp; -&nbsp; crucially intending however&nbsp; (as with Churchill)&nbsp; to proceed forthwith to join </span><span class=rvts8>your</span><span class=rvts5> forces.”&nbsp; It transpired that very many of the nobility in crucial positions throughout the country had also already agreed to oppose James.&nbsp; He and Feversham were simply the last to know of this growing nation-wide opposition.&nbsp; In one sense, it was an enormous&nbsp; risk to their&nbsp; respective lives and futures.&nbsp; After all, James had&nbsp; brought together the largest single army under an English flag that the nation had yet seen.&nbsp; It would all hinge on </span><span class=rvts8>their</span><span class=rvts5> uncertain loyalty. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Council of War was held by James and his top commanders on the evening of November 23 </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> probably as they marched from Windsor south-westward towards Salisbury.&nbsp; When asked their opinion in regard to the first move to be made against the enemy, Churchill and Grafton (then still with him) advised that they continue to advance toward them (to the west). while the top two French commanders thought it wiser to retreat eastwards once nearer Salisbury .</span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> possibly to draw William towards London and into some less favourable fighting ;position.&nbsp; Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s motivation regarding the advice he proffered has been much analysed&nbsp; but our author suggests it was likely designed to draw James further </span><span class=rvts8>away</span><span class=rvts5> from London so that Sarah and others could more safely convey Princess Anne (and themselves) from the capitol </span><span class=rvts8>towards the north</span><span class=rvts5> - where other aristocrats in on the plans (as the Duke of Devonshire in particular)&nbsp; could provide them with safe haven&nbsp; in such as Nottingham and Derby. Moreover, it would allow John Churchill to make easier contact with William when, at the last minute, he decided to join him.&nbsp; This decision took effect shortly after they arrived at their positions near Salisbury around midnight of the 23</span><span class=rvts16>rd</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; He, Grafton and Berkeley with 400 Officers and Troopers quietly re-mounted their horses and, as others slept,&nbsp; rode off towards Crewkerne, 50 miles </span><span class=rvts8>south-west</span><span class=rvts5>, being quite close to William and his forces, now at Axminster (as alluded to above) .&nbsp;&nbsp; By then,&nbsp; it was the morning of Nov 24</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at this pre-planned time that Churchill left behind him his crucial letter for the King.&nbsp; It read, essentially:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts4>Sir,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the fact that I could have no better advantage in life than to continue in your service, and accept that in your present position, you deserve the strictest obedience from all your subjects, especially from one with the greatest personal obligation to your majesty, I am nevertheless actuated by a higher principle and by the inviolable dictates of my conscience </span><span class=rvts3>in respect of my religion</span><span class=rvts4> and must therefore desert you at this time…but will ever seek to ,protect your royal person and lawful rights…</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Churchill.&nbsp;  </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of his allies in this endeavour, Prince George&nbsp; (Princess Anne</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s husband), wrote in similar vein from Denmark stressing that he “…could not in conscience but support all the other Princes in Europe against </span><span class=rvts9>the enemies of the Protestant church</span><span class=rvts5>, as backed by the zeal and cruelty of&nbsp; the prevailing Catholic power in France, by seeking the reinforcement of the democratic laws of that government (in England) on which alone both the well&nbsp; being of your majesty and </span><span class=rvts9>the future of the Protestant religion</span><span class=rvts5> in Europe depend.”&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that Churchill not only denied further support for his patron and monarch (finally) but had organised unspoken support for&nbsp; what was essentially a rebellion in all the crucial centres of&nbsp; power in the country&nbsp; - whether military or otherwise </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> at its simplest being&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts3>for</span><span class=rvts4> Protestantism and </span><span class=rvts3>against</span><span class=rvts4> Catholicism </span><span class=rvts5>(with their crucial implications for Democracy)</span><span class=rvts4>.&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp; That was the absolute crux of the matter </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> no</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> ifs</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> and no </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>buts</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>. It wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t a political or an economic conflict, but one </span><span class=rvts15>of religion</span><span class=rvts9> </span><span class=rvts15>and public decision-making</span><span class=rvts8>.</span><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts4>Who calls the shots ?&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts5>The Pope and a Catholic King,&nbsp; or&nbsp; the&nbsp; People </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> through a democratically elected Cabinet (who may well not&nbsp; be re-elected) ?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in the north, the Duke of Devonshire (centred on Derbyshire) raised 5000 men on horse locally.&nbsp; He&nbsp; would be involved in greeting the arrival of Princess Anne at nearby Nottingham </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> having been accompanied there by Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s wife Sarah who oversaw her safe departure from London on that key date of Nov 24</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5> (that fateful day) before James could return and possibly hold certain relatives as a kind of guarantee for, his own safety. But they weren</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t there.&nbsp; It was suggested by Churchill .the author, that it was this reversal of loyalty that had motivated some later writers to withhold support for his otherwise laudable exploits for the nation. It just wasn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t cricket. Some people feel that certain principles are inviolable </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as though pragmatism is </span><span class=rvts8>always</span><span class=rvts5> inferior to blindly adhered to </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>principle</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> often taken on board in youth </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> without analysis;&nbsp; Just on faith.&nbsp; Context is everything.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> large professional army had very quickly lost heart and many had indeed deserted to William</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s side - before any significant actions had transpired between them.&nbsp; The king&nbsp; soon returned&nbsp; to London once he realised his support was fast ebbing away and so assembled any Privy Councillors still in London for their advice.&nbsp; They advised him to enter into negotiations with William immediately and agree an amnesty for all those who supported him.&nbsp; James concurred while still intending (as became apparent later) not to properly cooperate - in order to gain time to arrange an escape to France </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> firstly for his wife and son,&nbsp; and for himself very shortly after. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was now about Dec 1</span><span class=rvts16>st</span><span class=rvts5> and William was in no hurry to deal with James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s negotiating Ministers, even though he knew they were basically all on his own side.&nbsp; He didn</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>t want any suggestions to arise that he, as a foreigner with some foreign troops,&nbsp; had actually invaded&nbsp; England - to overthrow its Catholic-minded monarch </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> who had properly succeeded to the throne --- </span><span class=rvts9>but,</span><span class=rvts5> with his Proclamation.&nbsp; He was simply the husband of James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> elder daughter Mary who was effectively replacing her father who had persistently refused to obey </span><span class=rvts9>the laws of England</span><span class=rvts5> (and his own Proclamation) </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts9>to lead a Protestant country</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; She and William would willingly so lead the country and effect same after a</span><span class=rvts8> bloodless</span><span class=rvts5> rebellion - overseen by Churchill.&nbsp; William would prefer not to have to negotiate anything.&nbsp; By Dec 9</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5>, James had finally successfully re-arranged the departure of his wife and son (an earlier attempt was refused by the Official ordered to arrange it - on the grounds that it would be seen as treason according to current English law).&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 2 am on&nbsp; Dec 11</span><span class=rvts16>th,</span><span class=rvts5>, James sought to follow them.&nbsp; There had been no negotiations.&nbsp; One could start with a tabula rasa. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James first sought to cause as much confusion as possible by deceiving the Council as to his intentions, by throwing the Great Seal into Thames,, by ordering Feversham to disband the army without pay, and his chief Admiral to sail his ships to Ireland&nbsp; (he&nbsp; surrendered them to William instead).&nbsp; The unpaid, mostly Irish soldiers ran riot amid rumours of their danger to the non-Catholic population. James then crossed the river and rode as fast as possible for the coast and a ship.&nbsp; Just what his status in law would be if he succeeded in leaving was uncertain.&nbsp; Had he abdicated, deserted or surrendered&nbsp; ?&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Dec 14</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5>,&nbsp; the Council in London had&nbsp; re-gained the initiative, subdued the riotous chaos there and </span><span class=rvts9>voted to acknowledge William</span><span class=rvts10>’</span><span class=rvts9>s authority</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; He was asked to hasten to London.&nbsp; The very next day, a countryman from Kent arrived at the Council, then sitting, to report that he was conveying </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>a message from the King</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; He had found a ship and boarded her but had missed the tide. He was mistaken for an escaping Jesuit priest and soon set upon roughly by the fishermen and townspeople. To restore some decorum, the Council authorised James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Gentleman of the Bedchamber</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>, one Ailesbury, to retrieve him personally from Sheerness (accompanied by various of his Household staff).&nbsp; Once back in London (by about Dec 19</span><span class=rvts16>th</span><span class=rvts5>) , William immediately arranged for him to be taken a short way </span><span class=rvts9>back down&nbsp; river</span><span class=rvts5> - to the port of Rochester in Kent.&nbsp; He also promoted rumours that James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> life there was in danger - as though encouraging a second escape attempt </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> as his return was most inconvenient politically.&nbsp; William then arranged that a back door where he was held be left unguarded and some departing ships conveniently available.&nbsp; This time, James finally succeeded (about Dec 21st) in leaving English soil for ever.&nbsp; William received the good news by Dec 23rd 1688.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one important sense, the country was </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>free at last</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> !&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While in normal circumstances, James</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> son would be expected to succeed his father, this would be made null and void once the latter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s refusal to adhere&nbsp; to his Proclamation became obvious and William and Mary were asked to assume the Crown jointly and maintain the established Protestant church of England.&nbsp; They were consequently crowned as such in April 1689.&nbsp;&nbsp; James would remained in exile -&nbsp; but seek to control events (as in Ireland) from abroad. Much had to await the debating in Parliament of the many unprecedented aspects arising from this never-before-experienced situation.&nbsp; So many questions were raised.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly when and why did Great Britain no longer have a Monarch ?&nbsp; Did James&nbsp; abdicate or desert ?&nbsp; Should his dis-enfranchisement&nbsp; be effected by Act of Parliament ?&nbsp; And what about his son;&nbsp; was he still his legal&nbsp; heir ? Should William reign on his own ?&nbsp;&nbsp; If Mary dies, who succeeds her (or William) ?&nbsp; Would it be Mary</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s sister Anne, or her new brother ?&nbsp; Much of all this was addressed by Parliament over the following 3 months of </span><span class=rvts4>1689</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, it was decided that William and Mary should reign jointly and on the latter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s death, that William should continue for his life, and then Anne should succeed.&nbsp; Again, John Churchill kept a low profile other that swearing his allegiance as described.&nbsp; As things developed, however, his role would necessarily become&nbsp; more central and relied upon.&nbsp; Amazingly, his greatest achievements were still to come </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> when serving William and Mary, and later Anne, over coming decades. . </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the first 3 months of 1690, negotiations of all kinds continued apace </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> involving the potential Crown, the Parliament and the Church.&nbsp; William would have preferred to rule as sole monarch but eventually accepted with good grace that he should only do so jointly with his wife Mary.&nbsp; In the event of her death before him, Parliament agreed that he would then rule as sole Monarch&nbsp; until his own death and that Mary</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s sister Anne would then assume the Crown, with her husband Prince George as Consort.&nbsp; He realised that John Churchill and wife Sarah held significant influence over Anne and made a point of declaring that they would not so </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>govern</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> him and Mary.&nbsp; However, because his main motivation was in overcoming the power of France in Europe, William soon made John Lieutenant General and thus practically Commander-in-Chief of the entire English Army.&nbsp; But, just as James had his French Feversham, so William had his Dutch Schomberg </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with his advice - as an intermediary between Churchill and the new King.&nbsp; Churchill had assumed a moderate middle course in all the prior negotiations and, as always, was happy to play the </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>;long game</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5> - of strategy, not tactics. .It paid off.&nbsp; In April at the Coronation, he was created&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts6>‘</span><span class=rvts5>Earl </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> of Marlborough</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may recall that the sister of John</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s grandmother Lady Eleanor Drake had married one James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough.&nbsp; By</span><span class=rvts4> 1665</span><span class=rvts5>, the then 3</span><span class=rvts16>rd</span><span class=rvts5> Earl of that title died (without heirs)&nbsp; in a sea battle&nbsp; against the Dutch.&nbsp; The&nbsp; title&nbsp; had become dormant&nbsp; and, having his choice of name for this honour, John chose it.&nbsp; Almost immediately after, in May </span><span class=rvts4>1690</span><span class=rvts5>, war was formerly declared against France.&nbsp; Marlborough (as he was now called) would lead an army of 8000 men, as the English contingent, against the French in Flanders. Four armies in total would be involved initially </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> those of the English, the Dutch , the Spanish and the Swedes.&nbsp; The Germans and the Empire force would soon join in.&nbsp; An effective world conflict had thus begun. on the continent&nbsp; and would reach its full intensity only gradually. Various sides would alter their allegiances as it suited their respective countries.&nbsp; Meanwhile, William himself was tied up in Ireland but he was saved by a diversion by Churchill from Europe to land in southern Ireland where he captured Cork and Kinsale to greatly relieve the King.&nbsp; There would then follow a hiatus in Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s career as William grew ever more jealous of the latter</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s skills; he would seek&nbsp; thwart his ambitions as best he could </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> for a time. </span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5>----&nbsp; ----&nbsp; ----&nbsp; ----&nbsp; ----</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have reached Chapter 20 in Churchill</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s biography (in pages, just one third through Vol I)&nbsp; and must leave it at this point.&nbsp; All subsequent Chapters in the remaining 3 Parts of the biography deal primarily with the detail of countless successful&nbsp; Battles&nbsp; across Europe (if mostly on the Rhine) until, in </span><span class=rvts4>1710</span><span class=rvts5>, France was finally conquered.&nbsp; The war had lasted from </span><span class=rvts4>1690</span><span class=rvts5> to that year, incorporating latterly the War of the Spanish Succession.&nbsp; It started in Flanders and ended there 20 years later.&nbsp; It might have more conveniently been called the</span><span class=rvts4> </span><span class=rvts7>‘</span><span class=rvts4>20 Years War</span><span class=rvts7>’</span><span class=rvts5>.&nbsp; The most crucial battle was that at Blenheim (on the Danube) on </span><span class=rvts4>13th Aug 1704</span><span class=rvts5> </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> when&nbsp; Marlborough crushed Tallard</span><span class=rvts6>’</span><span class=rvts5>s mostly French forces.&nbsp;&nbsp; Louis had to accept that he was now permanently on the defensive.&nbsp; It would still take another 5 years to mop up the remnants </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> with no fighting possible during the winters in those days.&nbsp; By </span><span class=rvts4>1714, </span><span class=rvts5>various </span><span class=rvts4>Treaties of Utrecht&nbsp;</span><span class=rvts5> had finally settled the essential structure and power in Europe, resulting from that prolonged War - for at least 200 years !. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Churchill was now created a Duke - of Marlborough, and Sarah, a Duchess of same.&nbsp; They were virtual Royalty.&nbsp; He died in </span><span class=rvts4>1722</span><span class=rvts5>, age 73, no doubt exhausted by super-human efforts over so many decades,&nbsp; and she in </span><span class=rvts4>1744</span><span class=rvts5>, age 90, still sharp as a tack and not to be messed with.&nbsp; They oversaw construction of Blenheim, a gift from the nation, but never resided there </span><span class=rvts6>–</span><span class=rvts5> preferring their beloved Ashwell House in St Albans, with its fruit trees by the River.&nbsp; He was however&nbsp; invited to observe the unveiling of a famous portrait of himself - to be hung in the main Hall at Blenheim. He studied it silently and carefully for several minutes and while noted for never extolling his many victories or virtues, was heard as he turned away to say, quietly to himself, reflectively&nbsp; “There </span><span class=rvts15>was</span><span class=rvts5> a Man”.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was buried in Westminster Cathedral but his body later moved to the Chapel at Blenheim, to lay permanently with Sarah there.&nbsp; Over a century later, Winston S.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our analysis of the Churchill family was motivated by reading the book on
    the Life of the Duke of Marlborough (John Churchill) written by his direct
    descendent  Sir Winston Churchill in the <b>1930</b>s.  That 1<sup>st</sup>
    Duke had died just over 300 years earlier.  We may wonder what was the
    connection between them.   <b> </b>Reference was made earlier to the
    sad loss of John Churchill Jnr, only son of John Churchill  and his wife
    Sarah, later Duchess of Marlborough, in <b>1703</b>.  He was a highly
    regarded, very bright student at Oxford University, aged about 17, when he
    contracted some illness and died there. Had he lived, one might well imagine him
as the future 2nd Duke of Marlborough – on his father’s death in  <b> 1722</b> -  the title likely to be carried  on by his sn on in turn.  As it was, however, that  title would effectively be held in
    abeyance;  its equivalent  however would at least be held by  his eldest sister - 
    Henrietta  Churchill(b. <b>1681</b>) -  as the  2nd<i> Duchess</i> of Marlborough
    (John’s wife Sarah being, by marriage,  the 1<sup>st</sup>  such Duchess
    automatically on her husband’s accession).  </p>

<p>          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marlborough title was so designed that it would always have
    a legal heir, whether male or female, with the proviso (via an Act of Parliamentt) hat after any given
    female heiress, it  was then to go to her eldest son, if any, othrwise to the eldest son of  her next sister 
    and so on.  The title should thus never become extinct. John Churchill, the 1st Duke died  in 1722 and, having no surviving son, the tiltle passed to his eldest daughter Henrietta Godolphin (nee Churchill) (b. 1681) and  on her death in 1733 (wirhout surviving male isse),  to the son of her lafe sister Anne (1683-1716). She  had married Charles Spencer,
    2<sup>rd</sup> surviving son of the 3rd Earl of Sunderland (also Charles
    Spencer), as his 2<sup>nd</sup> wife - in <b>1700<i>.</i></b>The estate and titles would  now go
   to  <b>Charles  Spencer (b. 1706)</b>,  Anne's eldest son 
      - </b>who thus became<b> </b>the
    3<sup>rd</sup> Duke of Marlborough from that year.  </p>
<p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Charles Spencer held the title for 25 years (having married an Elizabeth
    Trevor in 1<b>733</b>) – until his death  in <b>1758</b> – when their
 eldest son in turn  <b>George Spencer</b>  (b. <b>1739</b>) became the 4 <sup>th</sup> Duke (for almost 60 years !) and his son,  also George,  the
    5th Duke,- on his father’s death   in<b> 1817,  </b>and this youhger George  would hold<b> </b>
     same until<b> 1840.  Thus, </b>the Spencer family<b> </b>became<b> </b>
    virtually synonymous with the Marlborough title and Dukedom in most
    contemporary minds after such a lengthy pre-Victorian period.  The Spencers<i> were</i>
    effectively the Marlboroughs.  </p>
   <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had John Churchill’s only son, John Jnr, not died, aged 17, he would likely
    have married (by  ca <b> 1710</b>, say).  His choice of bride would no doubt
    have been from amongst the major English titled families (essentially
    Dukes).   Instead, his sisters married into the next layer of aristocracy –
    the Barons and Earls – who would thus provide the future Marlborough
    heirs, guided by the old adage:  'What we Have, we Hold'.   Interestingly, the Spencers were a family originally from the Midlands of England who had raised themselves up by their own ‘bootstraps',
     as it were (rather than by  inheriting estates acquired essentially from
    the time of the Conquest) and by subsequent prudent marriages amongst
    themselves. An early Spencer Yeoman and family had thus successfully raised and
    sold sheep In Warwickshire and neighbouring Northamptonshire. They
    gradually acquired (purchased) more land <u>from Savings</u> made possible by
    their widely acknowledged land management and husbandry skills.  Thus,
    their status evolved from that of Yeoman in the mid<i>-<b>1400</b>s</i> to
    those of Gentleman, Esquire and  Knighthood, through the reigns of the
    Tudors - during the<b> <i>1500</i>s</b>, until they were raised to the
Peerage itself  as Earls or Barons in <b>1603</b> – by James 1<sup>st</sup>.  <b><i>Acrag</i></b><i>e</i> – of<u> <i>good</i></u> land – was by far the measure of wealth and power in pre-industrial England;   as was  Trade  to some  extent,  and  holding  royal/court  and government positions (’Placements’) by means of 
     influential connections.  The sons and daughters amongst the
    limited number of Dukes and Earls married each other according primarily to
    the property-bargaining positions of their wealthy parents.
    </p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    When John Churchill was granted 10,000 acres and his
    Dukedom, he was suddenly like the  ‘new kid on the block’ – his daughters
    being eyed-up by those whose  families  were already of the Peerage - for
 a century or more.  Thus, in <b>1705</b>, Anne Churchill married  <b>Charles Spencer </b>(<b>1705-1768</b>)<b>, </b>soon to be his Spencer family’s 5<sup>th</sup> Earl   ‘of Sunderland’ (as of <b>1729 </b> -  their
    eldest surviving son (Robert, the 4<sup>th</sup> Earl) having died that
year<b>)</b>.  Their next son, Charles Jnr, then became the 5th Earl,    <u>and</u> the 3<sup>rd</sup> Duke of Marlborough in 1<b>733</b> on the death of his aunt Henrietta, the 2<sup>nd</sup> holder of the Dukedom – as  the 2nd Duchess of Marlborough    and he then held the title until his own death in
    <b>1758 </b>. </p> 
	<p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[We should   note here that  his next younger brother,<i> a John</i> Spencer
(b. <b>1708 </b>at the family seat at Althorp in Northamptonshire  - where his older brother Charles was  himself born 2 years before) would father a namesake son  <b>John Spencer</b>  <b>Jnr</b>
in <b>1734</b>  who, to confuse matters further, was  created<b><u>1<sup>st</sup> </u></b><u> <b>Earl  Spencer</b></u><b> </b> in    <b> 1761</b>  (and <b>Viscount Spencer</b> in<b> 1765</b>) -   i.e. not
    long after the death of his uncle the 3rd Duke of Marlborough  and the beginning of the
    tenure of the 4<sup>th</sup> Duke. This <i>other</i> branch and titled
    line of the Spencer family  also continued  - but seated at Althorp -   to
this day. Thus, during the<i> <b>1760</b>s</i>, <b>‘70s</b> and    <b>‘’80s </b>(and beyond) of the time of the 4<sup>th</sup> Duke, there were also Earls of Sunderland<b> Spencers,  </b> <b>Earls Spencer </b>per se    <b> </b> and Dukes of Marlborough <b>Spencers</b> – all essentially of that 
    same original family.   So it would continue over following centuries.  That new latter 
    title (of ‘<b>Earls Spencer’) </b>would thus lead to such descendants as Charles
    Edward Spencer, the 9<sup>th</sup> such Earl Spencer (b. <b>1964</b>) and
    his sister Lady Diana Spencer, who married Prince Charles in 1981.   They
    were thus <b>not</b> Spencers of the senior ’Earls of Sunderland’ line (nor
those of the later Dukes of Marlborough line  but, rather,  were those (males) titled <b>‘Earl Spencer’</b> – of  the original family seat still settled at or near Althorpe).  </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We return now to that  5<sup>th</sup> Duke of Marlborough (b. <b>1766)</b> who  began his tenure in<b> 1817</b> by deciding to seek permission (from whom?)  
     to assume and bear the surname <b><i>also</i></b> of his famous
    Churchill  ancestor (the 1<sup>st</sup> Duke), that is,  in addition to rhat of  his many Spencer forebears.  He, and his progeny, thus  acquired thereby
    the new surname of   <b>‘Spencer-Churchill’</b>.  What right he had in even seeking such a  change so long after John Churcill's career (over a century earlier) or what right anyone had to so grant same (other than a self-appointed College), I have no idea.    While benefiting from
    an excellent genetic inheritance (his mother was a Russell of the Dukes of
    Bedford family), an Eton/Oxbridge education and holding several political
    positions, he was however essentially a most profligate and self-indulgent
    collector (ie buyer) of very expensive antiques and rare books.  His debts soon
    mounted and once inheriting the Marlborough estate and title, he retired to
    Blenheim to live on a modest pension, having sold everything possible to try to 
    clear his debts.  He had married Susan Stewart, daughter of an Earl of
    Galloway in Scotlabd and had 4 legitimate children (and countless illegitimate ones apparently).
 He died penniless in <b>1840</b> but his eldest son and heir, the next (6    <sup>th</sup>)  Duke, seems to have had his own protected wealth.</p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He was yet another George Spencer, if now as  ‘George
    Spencer-Churchill’ (b. <b>1793</b>).  He too was educated at Eton and
    Oxford and became an active Tory MP promoting various progressive Bills
    until his own advancement to the bankrupt Dukedom (and thus to the House of Lords)
    in <b>1840</b>.   He died in <b>1857 </b>when he was  succeeded by his
    eldest son John<b> Winston Spencer-Churchill </b>(<b>1822-1883)</b> as the
7th Duk.   He was the Victorian grandfather of ‘ <b>Winston S. Churchill’</b>(as called)  who may well have remembered him, their lives over-lapping by 8 or 9 years.  He was a Conservative   politician, a
member of Disraeli’s Cabinet and father of    <b>Randolph Spencer-Churchill</b>, Winston’s father.   He married Frances Vane in<b> 1843</b> and had 11 children – including Winston’s father 
    Randolph (b. <b>1849</b>) who would however<u> not</u> become the next Duke
    as there was an older brother,  <b>George Charles Spencer-Churchill</b>,
    (b. <b>1844</b>), who would become the 8<sup>th</sup> Duke of Marlborough,
in <b>1883.</b>     He’d entered Eton in<b> 1857</b> but was expelled in  <b> 1859 </b>and sounded as though he was a bit of a loose cannon. 
    He joined the Army in<b> 1863, </b>having purchased a Commission in the
    Royal Horse Guards. He was attracted to the Free Masons and the Ancient
    Order of Druids. <b> </b>He fathered an illegitimate son 2 years before he
    married and later divorced a Duke’s daughter (who was unkindly described by
    his own mother as a rather “stupid, pious and dull girl") but with whom he had 4
    children including the future 9th Duke, Charles Robert Spencer-Churchill,
    in <b>1871.  (</b>The 8<sup>th</sup> Duke had married secondly but had no
    further issue.  He was cited as a co-respondent in a divorce case at the
    time and died at Blenheim in <b>1892</b>.</p>)
	
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 9<sup>th</sup> Duke, Charles Robert, was educated at
    Winchester and Cambridge before joining the Army and later had a successful
political career holding several high offices - along with his 1    <sup>st</sup> cousin and good friend Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill.  Sadly, his married
    life was not so smooth.  His marriage was arranged to a wealthy Vanderbilt
    daughter from America in order to rescue Blenheim from its immense debts but they had
    only   2 sons – ‘the heir and a spare’, as his wife described them.  They
    soon divorced and he re-married but had no other issue. The elder son John
Spencer-Churchill (b.<b> 1871) </b>inherited the estate and title in   <b> 1892 </b>on his father Charles’ death.<b>  </b>He in turn was succeeded
    by the 10<sup>th</sup> Duke, John Spencer-Churchill in<b> 1934</b>. He was
    born in<b> 1897</b> educated at Eton before joining the Life Guards,
      serving in both World Wars.   He married Alexandra <b>Cadogan 1920</b>
    and had a large family, including eldest son John George Spencer-Churchill
    b<b> 1926, who</b> succeeded in<b> 1971</b>.</p>
   
              <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Meanwhile, the younger brother of the 9th Duke, Randolph
    Spencer-Churchill, was pursuing his active political career (having no
    title to anticipate an income from).   He too attended Eton but went on to
    Oxford (unlike his older brother), and met there others whose politics
    would inter-act with his on many future occasions.  He was bright, verbally
    fluent but caustic with it – with few political allies.  He would marry
    Jennie Jerome, of a wealthy American family, but they would soon spend most
of their money.  They had just two sons –    <b>Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill</b> born later that same year (oddly
    at Blenheim - where they were spending a weekend and Winston arrived a bit  
    early), and his younger brother’ ‘Jack’ Spencer-Churchill, in <b>1880</b>
    Randolph’s   health failed him from then on and he died aged only 48 in <b> 1895</b>.  His wife married secondly   a well-off commoner.  </p>
	<p>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Winston attended Harrow, not Eton, and did not proceed to
    University. He did very poorly in exams and barely passed the entrance
    requirements for Sandhurst - on the third attempt. Like his famous
    ancestor, John Churchill,  he would  join the Army; and served in three
    theatres of War -  before entering parliament in <b>1900</b> where he
    served as MP  for 64 years,  both  as  a  Liberal and a Conservative,
     holding many of the highest offices (as had his father), although made
    many mistakes and  mis-calculations.  He was also a correspondent and
author of serious historical books.  He became Prime Minister in  <b>1940</b> by the acclimation of his  fellow peers  and soon inspired the nation - by
    his powerful oratory - to display the courage and determination to win the
    War against Germany, with vital Commonwealth and  American support.  The
    latter was fitting, he was half British and half American himself.    </p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Our interest here has been to show the connection between
John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, at the beginning of the 18    <sup>th </sup>century, and Winston S. Churchill, his direct descendent, 
     at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup>, when he wrote his lengthy account
    of him.   We find that while the Title has continued throughout that 300
year period, and beyond, it necessarily did so, from the time of the 1    <sup>st</sup> Duke’s death in <b>1722, </b>by way of the marriage and issue
    of his  daughter Anne, with a member of the <b>Spencer</b> family.  If it wasn’t
    for the suspect or uncertain motivation, much later, of the 5<sup>th</sup> Duke to
    incorporate the surname Churchill with his own of Spencer (after about a
century), our contemporary Winston would be rightly known to uS and  history  only as  <b>Winston L. Spencer.</b>  While he was presumably baptised as a Spencer-Churchill, as were both his father and grandfather, he seems to
have subtlely shifted his own identity by restricting his signed name to   <b>Winston S. Churchill</b>, at some point.  But, of course, he had  no  middle  Christian name - to be  so abbreviated,  as S.  The name  Spencer was but part of his family's single hyphenated<u> surname</u>.  He was indeed the direct
    descendent of John Churchill but nevertheless, did not possess the latter’s
    male Y chromosome – but, rather, that of the Spencers - passed down over many previous
    generations.  Sadly, John Churchill’s son, also John, did not have the
    opportunity to pass on that Y gene quality of his own Churchill  family’s amcient genes - from
    around <b>1710 </b>or so - which reached back to before <b> 1066</b>.    Instead, there followed that of an unbroken
    line of   10   eldest Spencers.  To be accorded an identity of partial
    Churchillian character – by assuming the label of ‘Spencer-Churchill’ may
    have been  tempting, but to later transform it all the way – to simplyimply 
      ‘Churchill’ per se,  seems rather naughty.   Thus, unlike John Churchill
    (ex Courcelles from Normandy), he wasn’t such a Churchill, nor even a
    Spencer-Churchill, but essentially <b>a Spencer –</b> albeit<b> </b>with an
    equally proud history of self-reliance emerging from about the time of the Wars of the
    Roses  <b> </b>by the <b>1480</b>.   The family in  1817 only now became known as a particular line of <u><b>Spencers</b>,</u> <i>not</i> of Churchills.   A century later, the popular press would effectively reverse that  reality - without justification; they were still all a type of Spencer, not a type of Churchill, including Winston Leonard.   </p>  
 
        <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Winston’s son Randolph (<b>1911-1966</b>) who
    possessed the more controversial character traits of both his father and 
grandfather, if not more so,  and his own son Winston (<b>1940</b> - <b>2010</b>) and  grandson  Randolph<b> (1965</b>-    ) in turn,  were all
     still registered as Spencer-Churchills, despite being more generally
    accorded the unqualified surname Churchill,  in more ommon parlance.  Again,
    they were more ‘properly’ neither Spencer-Churchills, nor Churchills, but simply 
    Spencers - of an unbroken line back to the earliest Earls of Sunderland
from 1603 and before that as the Spencers of Althorp back to the  mid  <b>1400s</b>– if, that is, ‘properly’ gives no credence to a subsequent 'late-in-the-day' 
     change in rhe the traditional acceptance of one’s paternal surname
    (on its own) in our culture.    And even single surname identities , if
     adopted  anew  - as  ‘Sunderland’,  ‘Halifax’, or ‘Newcastle’ , say,
    mask or obscure the bearer’s true family identity, and thus its origins. </p>

They would have just two children </span>–<span class=rvts26> Mathew </span>–<span class=rvts26> in about </span><span class=rvts56>1545</span><span class=rvts26> and Margaret about </span><span class=rvts56>1550 </span><span class=rvts60>–</span><span class=rvts56> </span><span class=rvts26>before Roger</span>’<span class=rvts26>s equally early death </span>–<span class=rvts26> around 1552.&nbsp; But, where is Roger Churchill</span>’<span class=rvts26>s IPM </span>–<span class=rvts26> which should have been taken </span><span class=rvts67>before</span><span class=rvts26> Jane</span>’<span class=rvts26>s re-marriage, seemingly within a tear - in about </span><span class=rvts56>1553</span><span class=rvts26> ? In any case, we continue now with the Preface to the IPM article, essesntially verbatim:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts76>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=rvts77>‘</span><span class=rvts26>There is probably no class of records which can compare with </span>‘<span class=rvts26>Inquisitiones Post Mortem</span>’<span class=rvts26>, whether from a genealogical or topographical standpoint. Without reference to them it is quite impossible to write trustworthy local history for the period before the days of the great rebellion [Civil War]. They form, in fact, the ground-work for the history of all landed property which happened to be held as </span>‘<span class=rvts26>tenant-in-chief</span>’<span class=rvts26>.&nbsp; To the students of London history they are, indeed, of the highest value, and we have, therefore, determined to take our readers to the very sources of our local history, and to print these records so fully that it will be unnecessary for them to trouble to consult the originals, which are now deposited in the Public Record Office. Every scrap of information will be preserved, and these abstracts will, to all practical purposes, be the inquisitions themselves, shorn of all legal verbiage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts26>We propose commencing with the reign of King Henry VII, and to proceed with subsequent reigns in chronological order, until the termination of this series of records in </span><span class=rvts56>1645</span><span class=rvts26>, in consequence of the abolition of the tenure of knight service.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts26>It may be well to give the reader some particulars respecting these inquisitions or inquests. It must be remembered that they are quite distinct from the inquests which are still taken by the coroner in order to ascertain the cause of death. They were concerned solely with the property held by the deceased, and were required for the purpose of determining the feudal rights which accrued to the Crown upon the death of any tenant in chief. Until the practical abolition of the service of knight serjeanty, in 1645</span>—<span class=rvts26> it was not formally abolished until the accession of King Charles II., in 1660</span>—<span class=rvts26>the Crown was entitled, at the death of each feudal tenant in chief, to levy certain feudal dues, into the particulars of which, however, it is unnecessary here to enter. If the heir-at-law happened to be a minor he became a ward of the Crown. This was a source of profit, for the wardship was frequently sold for hard cash, since it was a privilege of considerable value, meaning the right not only to receive the rents and profits, but also the right to find a spouse for the youthful heir. When the heir-at-law attained his majority, then he became the subject of further feudal exactions, for on suing out his ousterlemain, that is, livery of his lands by the Crown, he had to pay certain dues, and bring forward strict proof that he had attained his full age of twenty-one years. Amongst the inquisitiones post mortem are still to be found some few of these inquests for proof of age, </span><span class=rvts59>probatio etatis</span><span class=rvts26>, which are usually very interesting documents, on account of the evidence of the witnesses who were examined in order to show how they knew that the heir was of age. They include some inquiries taken </span><span class=rvts59>virtute officii</span><span class=rvts26>, and others </span><span class=rvts59>ad quod damnum</span><span class=rvts26>, besides inquests as to the property of lunatics and idiots. These we shall also include.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts26>The proceedings following on the death of any one who was supposed to be a tenant in chief were as follows: A writ, termed the writ of </span><span class=rvts59>diem clausit extremum</span><span class=rvts26>, which was a mediæval Latin synonym for </span><span class=rvts59>obiit</span><span class=rvts26>, was issued out of the Court of Chancery; this was directed usually to the escheator or feodary of the county in which the deceased was presumed to have been possessed of lands. It commanded him to hold an inquest and to summon a jury for the purpose. The inquiry thus held was upon the following points:</span>—</p>
<p class=rvps27><span class=rvts78>1. Of what lands the deceased died possessed.</span></p>
<p class=rvps27><span class=rvts78>2. Of whom and by what services the same were held.</span></p>
<p class=rvps27><span class=rvts78>3. The date of his death.</span></p>
<p class=rvps27><span class=rvts78>4. The name and age of the heir-at-law.</span></p>
<p class=rvps27><span class=rvts78>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In pursuance of the direction contained in the writ, the escheator or feodary summoned a jury of the county, who accordingly rendered their verdict upon their oath; this was engrossed upon parchment, and in due course delivered up into the Court of Chancery, and there duly filed. In the course of the inquest the dealings that the deceased had had with his property came under review, and this necessitated inquiries into family settlements and trusts affecting it, and consequently we often find such documents, including the deceased's will, are recited at length, thus affording us information of the highest value to the genealogist.</span></p>
<p class=rvps27><span class=rvts78>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officials in the Chancery in due course forwarded a copy of the inquisition into the King's Exchequer, in order that the officers there might collect the accruing feudal dues. Occasionally the jury made an insufficient or inaccurate return, and then a further writ, known as the writ </span><span class=rvts79>ad melius inquirendum</span><span class=rvts78>, was directed to the escheator, requiring him to hold a second inquest for better inquiring as to the facts omitted. Sometimes this process had to be repeated a second or third time.</span></p>
<p class=rvps27><span class=rvts78>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the reign of Henry VIII, in consequence of the alleged extortions on the part of the Crown officials, and the practice which had grown up of compelling landowners who were not tenants </span><span class=rvts79>in capite</span><span class=rvts78> to sue out their ousterlemain, the Court of Wards and Liveries was created, with the sole object of attending to the business arising from these Inquisitions. To this Court also were sent transcripts of the Inquisitiones post mortem. Consequently, until the thirty-fifth year of Henry VIII. there are two sets of Inquisitions, the original returns, known as the </span><span class=rvts79>Chancery series</span><span class=rvts78>, and the transcripts, or the </span><span class=rvts79>Exchequer series</span><span class=rvts78>. After that date must be added a third, the </span><span class=rvts79>Wards and Liveries series</span><span class=rvts78>. The existence of these two series of transcripts is a fortunate circumstance, for frequently they enable us to make good the deficiences in the Chancery series.</span></p>
<p class=rvps27><span class=rvts78>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The abstracts for \london, of which we now print the first instalment, are taken from the Chancery series, supplemented where needful by reference to the Exchequer transcripts.&nbsp; An ancient calendar of </span><span class=rvts79>i</span><span class=rvts78>nquisitiones post mortem, from the period of Henry VII. to Charles I., labelled "Escheats," may be found in the </span><span class=rvts80>‘</span><span class=rvts78> "</span><span class=rvts81>legal" search-book</span><span class=rvts82>’</span><span class=rvts78> at the Public Record Office. All the entries relating to the county of Middlesex and City of London were lately extracted and printed in pamphlet form under the editorship of the present writer. They number upwards of two thousand. As these records are in Latin, often not very easy to decipher, the advantage of readable abstracts in English is evident. [ [As it would be likewise if done for a county like Dorset !]</span></p>
