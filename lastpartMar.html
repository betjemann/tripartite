&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Having considered the Jermys of Marlingford and their possible off-shoots in Norwich and Happing Hundred, we may now return to the two Major branches of the Norfolk Jermys as  descended from brothers Francis and Robert Jermy - born close to one another at the beginning of the troublesome 17th century.  Their parents were <font color="blue"><b>John Jermy, Esq</font></b>, Barrister of Norwich, and his distant cousin Eleanor from the Stutton line.  After returning from a successful career in London, John seems to have obtained his useful position with the Diocese of Norwich - as their chief lawyer or Counsellor, who resided in Norwich - from about 1585.  As early as 1588/9, he was involved in legal cases in north Norfolk and advising on Dutchy of Lancaster cases there for Sir Francis Walsingham.  He may also have held the position of Steward for the Dean and Chapter of Norwich, among others, around this time.  Within a few years, in anticipation of his retirement, he was able to purchase the freehold of at least 4 major estates - those at Gunton and Bayfield in the north of the county, at Marlingford in mid-Norfolk and at Tivetshall (in the south).  As mentioned, he may have owned Saxlingham as well (ie over and above the several nearby parishes into which the Bayfield estate extended - seemingly as an independent entity).  But there were apparently other related Jermys in this mid-northern area before this - which we may briefly consider first.
